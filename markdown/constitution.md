# Constitution Of Alabama

## Article I. Declaration of Rights

### Sec. 1 Equality and rights of men.

That all men are equally free and independent; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.

### Sec. 2 People source of power.

That all political power is inherent in the people, and all free governments are founded on their authority, and instituted for their benefit; and that, therefore, they have at all times an inalienable and indefeasible right to change their form of government in such manner as they may deem expedient.

### Sec. 3 Religious freedom.

That no religion shall be established by law; that no preference shall be given by law to any religious sect, society, denomination, or mode of worship; that no one shall be compelled by law to attend any place of worship; nor to pay any tithes, taxes, or other rate for building or repairing any place of worship, or for maintaining any minister or ministry; that no religious test shall be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under this state; and that the civil rights, privileges, and capacities of any citizen shall not be in any manner affected by his religious principles.

### Sec. 3.01 Alabama Religious Freedom Amendment.

SECTION I. The amendment shall be known as and may be cited as the Alabama Religious Freedom Amendment.

SECTION II. The Legislature makes the following findings concerning religious freedom:

(1) The framers of the United States Constitution, recognizing free exercise of religion as an unalienable right, secured its protection in the First Amendment to the Constitution, and the framers of the Constitution of Alabama of 1901, also recognizing this right, secured the protection of religious freedom in Article I, Section 3.

(2) Federal and state laws "neutral" toward religion may burden religious exercise as surely as laws intended to interfere with religious exercise.

(3) Governments should not burden religious exercise without compelling justification.

(4) In Employment Division v. Smith, 494 U.S. 872 (1990), the United States Supreme Court virtually eliminated the requirement that the government justify burdens on religious exercise imposed by laws neutral toward religion.

(5) The compelling interest test as set forth in prior court rulings is a workable test for striking sensible balances between religious liberty and competing governmental interests in areas ranging from public education (pedagogical interests and religious rights, including recognizing regulations necessary to alleviate interference with the educational process versus rights of religious freedom) to national defense (conscription and conscientious objection, including the need to raise an army versus rights to object to individual participation), and other areas of important mutual concern.

(6) Congress passed the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, 42 U.S.C., § 2000bb, to establish the compelling interest test set forth in prior federal court rulings, but in City of Boerne v. Flores, 117 S.Ct. 2157 (1997), the United States Supreme Court held the act unconstitutional stating that the right to regulate was retained by the states.

SECTION III. The purpose of the Alabama Religious Freedom Amendment is to guarantee that the freedom of religion is not burdened by state and local law; and to provide a claim or defense to persons whose religious freedom is burdened by government.

SECTION IV. As used in this amendment, the following words shall have the following meanings:

Demonstrates

(1) . Meets the burdens of going forward with the evidence and of persuasion.

Freedom of religion

(2) . The free exercise of religion under Article I, Section 3, of the Constitution of Alabama of 1901.

Government

(3) . Any branch, department, agency, instrumentality, and official (or other person acting under the color of law) of the State of Alabama, any political subdivision of a state, municipality, or other local government.

Rule

(4) . Any government statute, regulation, ordinance, administrative provision, ruling guideline, requirement, or any statement of law whatever.

SECTION V. (a) Government shall not burden a person's freedom of religion even if the burden results from a rule of general applicability, except as provided in subsection (b).

(b) Government may burden a person's freedom of religion only if it demonstrates that application of the burden to the person:

(1) Is in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest; and

,(2) Is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental interest.

(c) A person whose religious freedom has been burdened in violation of this section may assert that violation as a claim or defense in a judicial, administrative, or other proceeding and obtain appropriate relief against a government.

SECTION VI. (a) This amendment applies to all government rules and implementations thereof, whether statutory or otherwise, and whether adopted before or after the effective date of this amendment.

(b) Nothing in this amendment shall be construed to authorize any government to burden any religious belief.

(c) Nothing in this amendment shall be construed to affect, interpret, or in any way address those portions of the First Amendment of the United States Constitution permitting the free exercise of religion or prohibiting laws respecting the establishment of religion, or those provisions of Article I, Section 3, of the Constitution of Alabama of 1901, regarding the establishment of religion.

SECTION VII. (a) This amendment shall be liberally construed to effectuate its remedial and deterrent purposes.

(b) If any provision of this amendment or its application to any particular person or circumstance is held invalid, that provision or its application is severable and does not affect the validity of other provisions or applications of this amendment.

### Sec. 3.02 Religious rights and liberties.

Every person shall be at liberty to worship God according to the dictates of his or her own conscience. No person shall be compelled to attend, or, against his or her consent, to contribute to the erection or support of any place of religious worship, or to pay tithes, taxes, or other rates for the support of any minister of the gospel. Property belonging to the state may be used to display the Ten Commandments, and the right of a public school and public body to display the Ten Commandments on property owned or administrated by a public school or public body in this state is not restrained or abridged. The civil and political rights, privileges, and capacities of no person shall be diminished or enlarged on account of his or her religious belief. No public funds may be expended in defense of the constitutionality of this amendment.

The Ten Commandments shall be displayed in a manner that complies with constitutional requirements, including, but not limited to, being intermingled with historical or educational items, or both, in a larger display within or on property owned or administrated by a public school or public body.

### Sec. 4 Freedom of speech and press.

That no law shall ever be passed to curtail or restrain the liberty of speech or of the press; and any person may speak, write, and publish his sentiments on all subjects, being responsible for the abuse of that liberty.

### Sec. 5 Unreasonable search and seizure; search warrants.

That the people shall be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and possessions from unreasonable seizure or searches, and that no warrants shall issue to search any place or to seize any person or thing without probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation.

### Sec. 6.01 Basic rights for crime victims.

(a) Crime victims, as defined by law or their lawful representatives, including the next of kin of homicide victims, are entitled to the right to be informed, to be present, and to be heard when authorized, at all crucial stages of criminal proceedings, to the extent that these rights do not interfere with the constitutional rights of the person accused of committing the crime.

(b) Nothing in this amendment or in any enabling statute adopted pursuant to this amendment shall be construed as creating a cause of action against the state or any of its agencies, officials, employees, or political subdivisions. The Legislature may from time to time enact enabling legislation to carry out and implement this amendment.

### Sec. 7 Accusation, arrest and detention; punishment limited to laws established prior to offense.

In cases of misdemeanor, the Legislature may by law dispense with a grand jury and authorize prosecutions and proceedings before any inferior courts as may be by law established. In all felony cases, except those punishable by capital punishment, the Legislature may by law dispense with a grand jury and authorize prosecutions and proceedings in any manner as may be provided by law if the defendant, after having had the advice of counsel of his or her choice or in the event he or she is unable to employ counsel, the advice of counsel which shall be appointed by the court, makes known in open court to a judge of a court having jurisdiction of the offense that he or she desires to plead guilty.

### Sec. 9 Double jeopardy; discharge of juries from cases.

### Sec. 13.5 Application of foreign law.

(a) This amendment shall be known and may be cited as the American and Alabama Laws for Alabama Courts Amendment.

(b) The law of Alabama provides:

(1) The State of Alabama has developed its unique public policy of laws based on the United States Constitution, as protected by Amendment 10 to the United States Constitution.

(2) Upon becoming a state in 1819, Alabama adopted its first constitutional and statutory enactments, upon which it has built the rights, privileges, obligations, and requirements of its government and citizens.

(3) Both the provisions of the Alabama Constitution and the statutes and regulations of the State of Alabama, with interpreting opinions by its courts of competent jurisdiction, have developed the state's public policy.

(4) The public policy of the State of Alabama protects the unique rights of its citizens beginning with Article I, Section 1 of the Constitution of Alabama of 1901, guaranteeing the equality and rights of men. Except as permitted by due process of law and the right of the people to vote for self-determination, the rights, privileges, and immunities of the citizens of the State of Alabama are inviolate.

(5) Different from the law of the State of Alabama is foreign law, which is any law, rule, or legal code, or system established, used, or applied in a jurisdiction outside of the states or territories of the United States, or which exist as a separate body of law, legal code, or system adopted or used anywhere by any people, group, or culture different from the Constitution and laws of the United States or the State of Alabama.

(6) Alabama has a favorable business climate and has attracted many international businesses. While Alabama business persons and companies may decide to use foreign law in foreign courts, the public policy of Alabama is to prohibit anyone from requiring Alabama courts to apply and enforce foreign laws.

(7) The public policy of this state is to protect its citizens from the application of foreign laws when the application of a foreign law will result in the violation of a right guaranteed by the Alabama Constitution or of the United States Constitution, including, but not limited to, due process, freedom of religion, speech, assembly, or press, or any right of privacy or marriage.

(8) Article IV, Section 1, of the United States Constitution provides that full faith and credit shall be given by each state to the public acts, records, and judicial proceedings of other states. Provided, however, when any such public acts, records, and judicial proceedings of another state violate the public policy of the State of Alabama, the State of Alabama is not and shall not be required to give full faith and credit thereto.

(c) A court, arbitrator, administrative agency, or other adjudicative, arbitrative, or enforcement authority shall not apply or enforce a foreign law if doing so would violate any state law or a right guaranteed by the Constitution of this state or of the United States.

(d) If any contractual provision or agreement provides for the choice of a foreign law to govern its interpretation or the resolution of any dispute between the parties, and if the enforcement or interpretation of the contractual provision or agreement would result in a violation of a right guaranteed by the Constitution of this state or of the United States, the agreement or contractual provision shall be modified or amended to the extent necessary to preserve the constitutional rights of the parties.

(e) If any contractual provision or agreement provides for the choice of venue or forum outside of the states or territories of the United States, and if the enforcement or interpretation of the contract or agreement applying that choice of venue or forum provision would result in a violation of any right guaranteed by the Constitution of this state or of the United States, that contractual provision or agreement shall be interpreted or construed to preserve the constitutional rights of the person against whom enforcement is sought. If a natural person subject to personal jurisdiction in this state seeks to maintain litigation, arbitration, an administrative proceeding, or a similarly binding proceeding in this state, and if a court of this state finds that granting a claim of forum non conveniens or a related claim violates or would likely lead to the violation of the constitutional rights of the nonclaimant in the foreign forum with respect to the matter in dispute, the claim shall be denied.

(f) Any contractual provision or agreement incapable of being modified or amended in order to preserve the constitutional rights of the parties pursuant to the provisions of this amendment shall be null and void.

(g) Nothing in this amendment shall be interpreted to limit the right of a natural person or entity of this state to voluntarily restrict or limit his, her, or its own constitutional rights by contract or specific waiver consistent with constitutional principles. However, the language of any such contract or other waiver shall be strictly construed in favor of preserving the constitutional rights of the natural person in this state. Further, no Alabama court shall be required by any contract or other obligation entered into by a person or entity to apply or enforce any foreign law.

(h) Except as limited by subsection (g), without prejudice to any legal right, this amendment shall not apply to a corporation, partnership, limited liability company, business association, or other legal entity that contracts to subject itself to foreign law in a jurisdiction other than this state or the United States.

(i) Where the public acts, records, or judicial proceedings of another state violate the public policy of the State of Alabama, the State of Alabama shall not give full faith and credit thereto.

### Sec. 14 State not to be made defendant.

That the State of Alabama shall never be made a defendant in any court of law or equity.

### Sec. 15 Excessive fines; cruel or unusual punishment.

That excessive fines shall not be imposed, nor cruel or unusual punishment inflicted.

(f) Reimbursement for expenses authorized pursuant to this section shall be paid in a timely manner that is consistent with expense reimbursement regulations jointly promulgated by the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House pursuant to the Alabama Administrative Procedure Act. Such regulations shall, to the extent possible, mirror similar regulations applicable to state employees. The President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House may not discriminate between members of the Legislature regarding the timely reimbursement of authorized expenses.

If any bill shall not be returned by the governor within six days, Sunday excepted, after it shall have been presented, the same shall become a law in like manner as if he had signed it, unless the legislature, by its adjournment, prevent the return, in which case it shall not be a law; but when return is prevented by recess, such bill must be returned to the house in which it originated within two days after the reassembling, otherwise it shall become a law, but bills presented to the governor within five days before the final adjournment of the legislature may be approved by the governor at any time within ten days after such adjournment, and if approved and deposited with the secretary of state within that time shall become law.

The legislature shall have the power to levy and collect taxes for state purposes on net incomes from whatever source derived within this state, including the incomes derived from salaries, fees and compensation paid from the state, county, municipality, and any agency or creature thereof, for the calendar year, 1933, and thereafter and to designate and define the incomes to be taxed and to fix the rates of taxes, provided that the rate shall not exceed 5 percent nor 3 percent on corporations. Income shall not be deemed property for purposes of ad valorem taxes. From net income an exemption of not less than fifteen hundred dollars ($1,500.00) shall be allowed to unmarried persons and an exemption of not less than three thousand dollars ($3,000.00) shall be allowed to the head of a family, provided that only one exemption shall be allowed to husband and wife where they are living together and make separate returns for income tax. An exemption of not less than three hundred dollars ($300.00) shall be allowed for each dependent member of the family of an income tax payer under the age of 18 years. The legislature shall reduce the ad valorem tax from time to time when and to such an amount as the revenue derived from the income tax will justify. In the event the legislature levies an income tax, such tax must be levied upon the salaries, income, fees, or other compensation of state, county and municipal officers and employees, on the same basis as such income taxes are levied upon other persons. All income derived from such tax shall be held in trust for the payment of the floating debt of Alabama until all debts due on Oct. 1st, 1932, are paid and thereafter used exclusively for the reduction of state ad valorem taxes.

Provided, further, that this section shall not be construed as to prevent the governor from paying interest at the rate of not exceeding 5% per annum payable semi-annually from July 1, 1933, on the floating indebtedness of the state at the close of business on September 30, 1932, as shown by outstanding and unpaid warrants drawn on the treasury, as provided by law, amounting in the aggregate to $16,943,357.12 and items enumerated in an act of the legislature number 294, being senate bill 272, approved November 9, 1932 [Acts 1932, Ex.

Any act creating or incurring any new debt against the state, except as herein provided for, shall be absolutely void. To create a sinking fund for the prompt and faithful payment of the floating indebtedness of the state, and interest thereon, the net proceeds of any income tax which may be levied by the legislature pursuant to law is hereby pledged.

In case there is, at the end of any fiscal year, insufficient money in the state treasury for the payment of all proper claims presented to the state comptroller for the issuance of warrants, the comptroller shall issue warrants for that proportion of each such claim which the money available for the payment of all said claims bears to the whole, and such warrants for such prorated sums shall thereupon be paid by the state treasurer. At the end of each fiscal year all unpaid appropriations which exceed the amount of money in the state treasury subject to the payment of the same after the proration above provided for, shall thereupon become null and void to the extent of such excess. Any person violating any of the provisions of this amendment shall, on conviction, be punished by a fine of not exceeding five thousand dollars, or by imprisonment in the penitentiary for not more than two years, one or both, at the discretion of the jury trying the same, and the violation of any provisions of this amendment shall also be ground for impeachment.

The bonds shall be general obligations of the state of Alabama and the full faith and credit and taxing power of the state are hereby pledged to the prompt and faithful payment of the principal of the bonds and the interest thereon. The proceeds from the sale of such bonds are hereby appropriated and shall be used exclusively for the purpose of paying the expenses incurred in the sale and issuance thereof and for the construction, alteration, improvement, enlargement and equipment of exhibition buildings and related facilities, including parking areas and ramps, roadways, sewers, curbs, and gutters, but not including the purchase of sites therefor. Such buildings and facilities shall be constructed by a space science exhibit commission, or such other state agency as may be created by act of the legislature, and shall be operated by or in cooperation with the Department of the Army and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration under such arrangements as may be authorized by law.

None of the bonds shall be sold for less than face value plus accrued interest thereon to the date of delivery, and all of the bonds shall be sold only at public sale or sales, either on sealed bids or at public auction, after such advertisement as may be prescribed by the said commission, to the bidder whose bid reflects the lowest net interest cost to the state computed to the respective maturities of the bonds sold; provided, that if no bid deemed acceptable by the said commission is received all bids may be rejected.

The bonds shall be signed in the name of the state by the governor and countersigned by the chairman of the commission and the great seal of the state of Alabama or a facsimile thereof shall be impressed, printed or otherwise reproduced thereon and shall be attested by the signature of the secretary of state; provided that facsimile signatures of any one or any two (but not all) of said officers may be reproduced on such bonds in lieu of their manually signing the same.

If a majority of the qualified electors of any county in the state, except Mobile and Jefferson counties, who participate in an election held therein pursuant to the provisions of any amendment to the Constitution heretofore adopted shall vote at such election in favor of the levy and collection of a special county tax, within the limitations provided in such amendment, for any one or more of the purposes included within the meaning of the term public hospital purposes, the proceeds derived from the tax authorized at such election may be applied for any one or more of the purposes for which said tax may be so voted.

The governing body of each county in which the said tax may be voted shall have the further power to designate as the agency of the county to acquire, construct, equip, operate and maintain public hospital facilities any public corporation heretofore or hereafter organized for hospital purposes in the county under any general law heretofore or hereafter enacted by the legislature.

Said public corporation may anticipate the proceeds from said tax so required to be paid to it by issuing, for any one or more of the purposes for which the tax shall have been voted, the bonds, warrants, or certificates of indebtedness of said public corporation, and may pledge for the payment of the principal thereof and interest thereon not exceeding 75% of the annual proceeds from said tax so paid to it.

Each county in which the tax shall be voted, and in the event a public corporation shall have been designated as the agency of such county pursuant to the provisions hereof then said public corporation, shall have the power to contract with any other county or similar public corporation with respect to the acquisition by purchase, lease, or otherwise, and the construction, equipment, operation, and maintenance of public hospital facilities outside of the county and within any zone or region of which the county may be a part, and which may have heretofore been established or may hereafter be established for public hospital purposes by the legislature or by any agency designated by it, the obligations of such contract to be payable solely out of the proceeds of said tax; provided, that the proceeds of said tax shall not be used outside of the county for any purpose for which the proceeds could not be used in the county, and shall not be used with respect to public hospital facilities located outside of the county if the tax is voted specifically for public hospital facilities located in the county.

No securities issued or contracts made by a county under the authority of this amendment, which are payable solely out of the proceeds of said tax, and no securities issued or contracts made by any such public corporation, whether or not issued or made under the authority of this amendment, shall be construed to be bonds of the county or of a political subdivision thereof within the meaning of section 222 of the Constitution, or construed to create or constitute an indebtedness of the county within the meaning of section 224 of the Constitution. Said securities shall be construed to be negotiable instruments notwithstanding the fact that they may be payable solely from a limited source. All pledges of said tax and all contracts made with respect thereto pursuant to the provisions of this amendment shall take precedence in the order in which they are made and shall create a charge on the proceeds of said tax prior to the expenses of operating and maintaining any public hospital facilities.

In each instance in which a special county tax for any one or more of the purposes included within the meaning of the term "public hospital purposes" has heretofore been authorized at an election held in a county pursuant to the provisions of any amendment to the Constitution heretofore adopted, all provisions of this amendment shall be applicable in said county to the same extent as if said election had been held after the adoption of this amendment.

This amendment shall be self-executing.

### Sec. 215.04 Use of certain special county taxes for hospital care and treatment of indigent residents.

The legislature may authorize the use of any portion of the proceeds of any special county tax levied for the purpose of acquiring, constructing, equipping, operating, and maintaining public hospitals, public clinics, public health centers, and related public health facilities of any kind, or for any one or more of the purposes included within the meaning of the term "public hospital purposes," for the purpose of providing hospital care and treatment for indigent residents of the county, or for the purpose of matching any state or federal funds made available for use in providing hospital care and treatment for indigent residents of the county, any provision of the Constitution to the contrary notwithstanding. Provided, however, that if any portion of the proceeds of such tax shall have been pledged to the payment of any bonds, warrants, notes, or other obligations or evidences of indebtedness, such portion of the proceeds of the tax as shall have been so pledged shall not be used for any purpose except in payment of such bonds, warrants, notes, or other obligations or evidences of indebtedness.

### Sec. 215.05 Special property tax by counties or municipalities for library purposes.

 (a) On and after October 1, 1978, all taxable property within this state, not exempt by law, shall be divided into the following classes for the purposes of ad valorem taxation:

Class I. All property of utilities used in the business of such utilities.

Class II. All property not otherwise classified.

Class III. All agricultural, forest and single-family owner-occupied residential property, and historic buildings and sites.

Class IV. All private passenger automobiles and motor trucks of the type commonly known as "pickups" or "pickup trucks" owned and operated by an individual for personal or private use and not for hire, rent or compensation.

(b) With respect to ad valorem taxes levied by the state, all taxable property shall be forever taxed at the same rate. On and after October 1, 1978, such property shall be assessed for ad valorem tax purposes according to the classes thereof as herein defined at the following ratios of assessed value to the fair and reasonable market value (except as otherwise provided in subsection (j) hereof) of such property:

Class I. 30 per centum.

Class II. 20 per centum.

Class III. 10 per centum.

Class IV. 15 per centum.

(b) With respect to ad valorem taxes levied by counties, municipalities or other taxing authorities, all taxable property shall be forever taxed at the same rate. On and after October 1, 1978, such property shall be assessed for ad valorem tax purposes according to the classes of property defined in subsection (a) hereof and at the same ratios of assessed value to the fair and reasonable market value thereof as fixed in subsection (b) hereof, except as otherwise provided in subsection (j) hereof and this subsection (such ratios being herein called "assessment ratios"). In connection with the ad valorem taxes that a county, municipality or other taxing authority is authorized or required to levy and collect pursuant to any provision of this Constitution, for the ad valorem tax year beginning October 1, 1978, any such taxing authority may, subject to criteria established by act of the legislature, by resolution of the governing body of that taxing authority, at any time not later than September 30, 1979, increase or decrease the assessment ratio applicable to any class of taxable property, such increase or decrease to be effective for ad valorem tax years beginning on and after October 1, 1978. If (1) a county, municipality or other taxing authority adjusts an assessment ratio pursuant to the preceding sentence and (2) the receipts from all ad valorem taxes levied by or with respect to such taxing authority during the ad valorem tax year beginning October 1, 1978, exceed by more than five percent, or are less than 95 percent of, the receipts from such ad valorem taxes for the ad valorem tax year beginning October 1, 1977, then at any time not later than September 30, 1980, for ad valorem tax years beginning on and after October 1, 1979, the taxing authority may, subject to criteria established by act of the legislature, by resolution of the governing body of that taxing authority, adjust any assessment ratio applicable to any class of taxable property. On and after October 1, 1979, the governing body of any county, municipality or other taxing authority may, subject to criteria established by act of the legislature, at any time increase or decrease the assessment ratio applicable to any class of taxable property; provided, that any proposed adjustment to an assessment ratio to be made pursuant to this sentence, whether an increase or a decrease, shall have been (1) proposed by the governing body of the taxing authority after a public hearing on such proposal, (2) thereafter approved by an act of the legislature, and (3) subsequently approved by a majority vote of the qualified electors residing in the taxing authority who vote on the proposal at a special election called and held in accordance with the law governing special elections. No decrease in an assessment ratio pursuant to this subsection (c) shall be permitted with respect to either of the ad valorem tax years beginning October 1, 1978, and October 1, 1979, if such county, municipality or other taxing authority has increased any millage rate under subsection (e) of this section with respect to such ad valorem tax year. The legislature shall enact general laws applicable to all counties, municipalities and other taxing authorities regulating and establishing criteria for the exercise of the powers granted such taxing authorities to adjust assessment ratios as hereinabove provided. Such assessment ratios as herein authorized may vary among taxing authorities so long as each such assessment ratio is uniform within a taxing authority. Any decrease in any assessment ratio pursuant to this subsection shall not jeopardize the payment of any bonded indebtedness secured by any tax levied by the taxing authority decreasing the assessment ratio. Any action authorized by this subsection to be taken by a taxing authority, or the governing body thereof, shall, other than in the case of a municipality, be taken by resolution of the governing body of the county in which such taxing authority is located acting on behalf of such taxing authority.

(d) With respect to ad valorem taxes levied by the state or by any county, municipality or other taxing authority, no class of taxable property shall have an assessment ratio of less than five per centum nor more than 35 per centum.

(e) A county, municipality or other taxing authority may decrease any ad valorem tax rate at any time, provided such decrease shall not jeopardize the payment of any bonded indebtedness secured by such tax. For the ad valorem tax year beginning October 1, 1978, when the tax assessor of each county shall complete the assembly of the assessment book for his county for that ad valorem tax year and the computation of ad valorem taxes that will be paid upon such assessment, he shall certify to each authority within his county that levies an ad valorem tax the amount of ad valorem tax that will be produced by every levy in that ad valorem tax year but excluding for this purpose any assessment of new taxable property not previously subject to taxation (except "escaped" property as defined by law) added to the tax rolls of such county for the ad valorem tax year in which such certification is made that was not included on the tax rolls for the next preceding ad valorem tax year. Any county, municipality or other taxing authority, at any time not later than September 30, 1979, may increase the rate at which any ad valorem tax is levied by or with respect to that taxing authority above the limit otherwise provided in this Constitution, provided that the amount of the above-described certification of anticipated tax receipts with respect to such tax is less than 120 percent of the actual receipts from such tax for the ad valorem tax year beginning October 1, 1977, such increase to be effective for ad valorem tax years beginning on and after October 1, 1978; provided, that any such millage increase shall not exceed in mills the total of (i) the number of additional mills that is necessary, when added to the millage rate imposed with respect to such tax on each dollar of taxable property situated in the taxing authority for the ad valorem tax year beginning October 1, 1977, to produce revenue that is not less than and that is substantially equal to that received by the taxing authority with respect to such tax during such immediately preceding ad valorem tax year, plus (ii) a number of additional mills equal to 20 percent of the total mills imposed by that taxing authority with respect to such tax on each dollar of taxable property situated in the taxing authority for the ad valorem tax year beginning October 1, 1977. If, for the ad valorem tax year beginning October 1, 1978, the receipts from any ad valorem tax with respect to which any millage rate has been increased pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence are less than 95 percent of the receipts from such ad valorem tax for the ad valorem tax year beginning October 1, 1977, then at any time not later than September 30, 1980, the taxing authority may increase any millage rate with respect to such ad valorem tax in the manner provided in the immediately preceding sentence, such increase to be effective for ad valorem tax years beginning on and after October 1, 1979. It is further provided that all millage adjustments shall be made in increments of not less than one tenth () mill.

(f) On and after October 1, 1979, any county, municipality or other taxing authority may at any time increase the rate at which any ad valorem tax is levied above the limit otherwise provided in this Constitution; provided, that the proposed increase to be made pursuant to this subsection shall have been (1) proposed by the governing body of the taxing authority after a public hearing on such proposal, (2) thereafter approved by an act of the legislature, and (3) subsequently approved by a majority vote of the qualified electors residing in the taxing authority who vote on the proposal at a special election called and held in accordance with the law governing special elections. Any adjustments or other actions authorized to be made or taken pursuant to this subsection and subsection (e) hereof shall be made or taken by resolution of the governing body of such taxing authority, or if there is no such governing body and in the case of a taxing authority other than a municipality, by resolution of the governing body of the county in which such taxing authority is located acting on behalf of such taxing authority. The provisions of subsections (c), (e) and (f) of this section shall not apply to ad valorem taxes levied by the state.

(g) The legislature is authorized to enact legislation to implement the provisions of this section and may provide for exemptions from taxation; provided, that unless otherwise expressly provided, no amendment to this section shall be construed to repeal any statutory exemption existing on the effective date of any such amendment hereto.

(h) Wherever any constitutional provision or statute provides for, limits or measures the power or authority of any county, municipality or other taxing authority to levy taxes, borrow money or incur indebtedness in relation to the assessment of property therein for state taxes or for state and county taxes, such provision shall mean as assessed for county or municipal taxes, as the case may be.

(i) Except as otherwise provided in this Constitution, including any amendment thereto whenever adopted with respect to taxable property located in the city of Mountain Brook, the city of Vestavia Hills, or the city of Huntsville, the amount of ad valorem taxes payable to the state and to all counties, municipalities and other taxing authorities with respect to any item of taxable property described as Class I property shall never exceed 2 percent of the fair and reasonable market value of such taxable property in any one ad valorem tax year, such amount with respect to any item of Class II property shall never exceed 1 percent of the fair and reasonable market value of such taxable property in any one ad valorem tax year, such amount with respect to any item of Class IV property shall never exceed 1 percent of the fair and reasonable market value of such taxable property in any one ad valorem tax year, and such amount with respect to any item of Class III property shall never exceed 1 percent of the fair and reasonable market value of such taxable property in any one ad valorem tax year. Whenever the total amount of ad valorem property taxes otherwise payable by any taxpayer with respect to any item of taxable property shall exceed in any one ad valorem tax year the maximum amount of such taxes permitted by this section, such amount of taxes shall be reduced by subtracting that amount of tax due that is in excess of the amount of tax otherwise permissible under the Constitution. In connection with the taxation of any item of taxable property, the amount of tax to be subtracted with respect to each authority levying and collecting any ad valorem property tax shall be in the same proportion to the total amount of tax to be subtracted that the total number of mills on each dollar of taxable property situated in the taxing authority levied by such taxing authority bears to the total number of mills on each dollar of taxable property situated in the taxing authority levied by all taxing authorities with respect to such item of taxable property. Before sending to any taxpayer any notice relating to the collection of ad valorem taxes, the tax collector in each county shall determine whether any portion of the amount of ad valorem property tax otherwise due with respect to any item of taxable property shall be subtracted pursuant to the provisions of this subsection and shall apportion the amount to be subtracted in accordance with the provisions of this subsection.

(j) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, on and after October 1, 1978, taxable property defined in subsection (a) hereof as Class III property shall, upon application by the owner of such property, be assessed at the ratio of assessed value to the current use value of such taxable property and not the fair and reasonable market value of such property. The legislature may enact laws uniformly applicable to the state and all counties, municipalities and other taxing authorities establishing criteria and procedures for the determination of the current use value of any eligible taxable property and procedures for qualifying such property for assessment at its current use value. The legislature may also enact laws uniformly applicable to the state and all counties, municipalities and other taxing authorities providing for the ad valorem taxation of any taxable property ceasing to qualify for current use valuation; provided, however, that any additional tax on taxable property ceasing to qualify for current use valuation shall not apply to more than the three ad valorem tax years immediately preceding such cessation of qualification (including as one such year the year in which cessation of qualification occurs).

(k) The following property shall be exempt from all ad valorem taxation: the real and personal property of the state, counties and municipalities and property devoted exclusively to religious, educational or charitable purposes, household and kitchen furniture, all farm tractors, all farming implements when used exclusively in connection with agricultural property and all stocks of goods, wares and merchandise.

##### (l)

 Notwithstanding the other provisions of this section, with respect to the costs of reappraisal incident to the state-wide reappraisal of property heretofore authorized by the legislature, each county, municipality or other taxing authority for ad valorem tax years beginning on and after October 1, 1978, may impose and levy an additional ad valorem tax of not more than two mills on all taxable property located in the taxing authority in order to reimburse itself for its payment of such costs of reappraisal or to pay any unpaid costs or its pro rata share of such unpaid costs of reappraisal. The taxes provided for in this subsection, or any pro rata part thereof, shall terminate at the end of the ad valorem tax year in which sufficient funds are received from the taxes to pay in full the said reappraisal costs and any receipts from such taxes that are received during the ad valorem tax year of their termination that are not needed for the purposes specified herein may be used by the taxing authority levying the tax for general purposes of the taxing authority. The taxes authorized in this subsection shall not exceed in the aggregate, with respect to any item of taxable property located in the taxing authority, a total of two mills for all such taxes levied by all taxing authorities in a county and not two mills for each taxing authority in a county. If more than one such taxing authority in a county has paid or owes all or a portion of its reappraisal costs, such two mills shall be prorated among such taxing authorities in the county as they may agree, or if they cannot agree, in the percentage which each such taxing authority's costs of reappraisal bear to the total costs of reappraisal of all taxing authorities in the county. The provisions of this subsection shall apply only to the costs incurred by a taxing authority incident to the statewide reappraisal of property heretofore authorized by the legislature, the amount of which costs shall be certified by the department of revenue, and shall not be applicable to any future reappraisals that may be required by law.

(m) If any portion of this section should be declared invalid by any court of competent jurisdiction, such invalidity shall not affect the validity of any of the remaining portions of this section, which shall continue effective.

### Sec. 218 Counties and municipal corporations exempt from payment of charges payable from state treasury.

The legislature shall not have the power to require counties or other municipal corporations to pay any charges which are now payable out of the state treasury.

### Sec. 219 Estate taxes.

The legislature shall have the power to levy such inheritance or estate taxes in the state of Alabama only so long as and during the time an inheritance or estate tax is enforced by the United States against Alabama inheritances or estate, and shall only be exercised or enforced to the extent of absorbing the amount of any deduction or credit which may be permitted by the laws of the United States now existing or hereafter enacted to be claimed by reason thereof as deduction or credit against such similar tax of the United States applicable to Alabama inheritances or estates.

### Sec. 219.01 Game and Fish Fund.

##### Section 3

. (a) The trust fund shall be under the management and control of the board, and all powers necessary or appropriate for the management and control of the trust fund shall be vested solely in the board. The board shall have a membership of nine trustees consisting of the governor, the state treasurer, the director of finance (or such other official as may by law succeed to the responsibilities of the director of finance), three trustees appointed by the governor, two trustees appointed by the lieutenant governor, and one trustee appointed by the speaker of the house of representatives. The governor, the state treasurer and the director of finance shall each serve as a trustee ex officio, and the service of each such official as a trustee shall begin and end concurrently with the beginning and end of his or her tenure in such office. As promptly as practicable after the effective date of this amendment, the other trustees shall be appointed for the following initial terms: The trustees to be appointed by the governor shall be appointed for terms beginning immediately upon their respective appointments and ending at noon on October 1, in the first, second and third calendar years, respectively, next following the calendar year in which this amendment shall become effective; the trustees to be appointed by the lieutenant governor shall be appointed for terms beginning immediately upon their respective appointments and ending at noon on October 1, in the fourth and fifth calendar years, respectively, next following the calendar year in which this amendment shall become effective; and the trustee to be appointed by the speaker of the house of representatives shall be appointed for a term beginning immediately upon his or her appointment and ending at noon on October 1, in the sixth calendar year next following the calendar year in which this amendment shall become effective. Thereafter, the term of office of each appointed trustee shall be six years, commencing at noon on October 1 on which the term of the immediate predecessor trustee shall end.

(b) If at any time there shall be a vacancy among the appointed trustees, a successor trustee shall be appointed to serve for the unexpired term applicable to such vacancy. The appointment of each appointed trustee (other than those initially appointed), whether for a full six-year term or to complete an unexpired term, shall be made by the same officer of the state who appointed the trustee whose term shall have expired or is to expire or in whose position on the board a vacancy otherwise exists and shall be made not earlier than 30 days prior to the date on which such trustee is to take office as such. Each appointed trustee shall hold office from the effective date of his or her appointment by and with the consent of the senate and shall hold office until his or her successor is appointed as provided for herein. Trustees shall be eligible for reappointment without limit as to the number of terms previously served.

(c) At the beginning of each session of the legislature the governor shall certify to the senate for confirmation the names of all who shall have been appointed as trustees since the commencement of the last session of the legislature.

(d) Each appointed trustee shall, at the time of his or her appointment and at all times during his or her term of office, be a qualified elector of the state, and a failure by any trustee to remain so qualified during such term shall cause a vacancy of the office of such trustee. Each appointed trustee shall have recognized competence and experience in the evaluation and management of investments. Any appointed trustee may be impeached and removed from office as a trustee in the same manner and on the same grounds provided in section 174 of the Constitution of Alabama of 1901, or successor provision thereof, and the general laws of the state for impeachment and removal of the officers of the state subject to said section 174 or successor provision thereof.

Appointed trustees shall be entitled to such compensation for their services as may from time to time be provided by law duly enacted by the legislature, but the power to provide compensation of appointed trustees shall be discretionary with the legislature and nothing in this amendment shall be construed to confer upon such trustees an absolute right to any compensation for their services. Each trustee shall be reimbursed for expenses actually incurred in the performance of his or her duties as a trustee.

(f) A majority of the trustees shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business by the board, and decisions shall be made on the basis of a majority of the quorum then present and voting, with each trustee to have a single vote.

The governor shall be the chairman and presiding officer of the board. The director of finance shall be vice chairman, and the state treasurer shall serve as secretary. The board may appoint such other officers to perform such duties, not inconsistent with the provisions of this amendment or applicable law, as the board shall deem necessary or appropriate.

Any meeting held by the board for any purpose shall be open to the public, except that executive sessions may be held by the board when the character or good name of a person is involved. All proceedings of the board, except executive sessions, shall be reduced to writing on behalf of the board and maintained in the permanent records of the board, a copy of which shall be filed in the principal office of the board and shall be open for public inspection there during regular business hours. The principal office of the board shall be the principal office of the director of finance.

(g) No trustee shall vote on or participate in the discussion or consideration of any matter coming before the board in which such trustee, personally or through family connections or business associations, has any direct or indirect pecuniary interest, including, but without limitation thereto, decisions of the board concerning the investment of moneys constituting part of the trust fund in any deposit or obligation of any bank or corporation in which such trustee may have such an interest. If there shall be brought before the board any matter in which a trustee shall have any interest which may conflict with his or her duties as a trustee, he or she shall immediately make a complete disclosure to the board of such interest and shall thereafter withdraw from participation in any deliberation and decision of the board with respect to such matter.

(h) The board shall have all of the powers necessary to carry out and effectuate the purposes and provisions of this amendment, including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the following powers:

(1) To adopt, alter and repeal bylaws, regulations and rules for the regulation and conduct of its affairs and business;

,(4) To appoint, employ and contract with such employees, agents, advisors and consultants, including, but not limited to, attorneys, accountants, financial experts and such other advisors, consultants and agents as may in its judgment be necessary or desirable, and to fix their compensation; provided, however, that any obligation created or assumed by the board shall not create any pecuniary obligation or liability of the state or the trust fund other than such as shall be payable out of moneys appropriated by the legislature to defray the expenses of the board in carrying out the purposes of this amendment. No lien or charge against any assets of the trust fund for any purpose whatsoever shall be created by or result from any law enacted by the legislature or any action taken by the board or any other department, agency or instrumentality of the state.

(i) The expenses of making and disposing of investments, such as brokerage commissions, legal expenses referable to a particular transaction, transfer taxes and other customary transactional expenses shall be payable out of any trust income of the trust fund. The legislature shall provide for the administrative and other necessary expenses of the board in the same manner as it provides for the expenses of operating other departments and agencies of the state.

Promptly following the effective date of this amendment, the state treasurer shall take all actions necessary to transfer to the board the possession, control and management of the initial trust capital. If at the time of such transfer into the trust fund all or part of the initial trust capital is invested in certificates of deposit or other investments which cannot be converted into cash prior to the maturity thereof without loss of interest or other penalty, the state treasurer shall directly transfer such certificates of deposit or other investments to the board as part of the initial trust capital without first converting the same into cash. In the event that any certificates of deposit or other investments shall be transferred into the trust fund, the initial trust capital shall not include the income or profit from such certificates of deposit or other investments that has been received by the state on or before such transfer or that constitutes accrued interest, amortized discount or other amounts which in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, should be considered as having been earned by the state as of the date of such transfer. Any such income or profits from such certificates of deposit or other investments that has been received by the state on or before such transfer shall remain in the general fund subject to appropriation by the legislature. To the extent that any income or profit derived from such certificates of deposits or other investments is referable to any period after the transfer thereof into the trust fund, such income or profit shall not constitute trust capital nor trust income but shall remain in the general fund subject to appropriation by the legislature.

(b) The trust capital shall be augmented by (i) such other moneys or assets as the legislature may by law appropriate and transfer to the trust fund as a permanent part thereof; (ii) such other moneys or assets as may be contributed to the trust fund from any source; and (iii) all proceeds of any oil and gas capital payments as defined in this amendment subsequent to August 14, 1984; provided, however, that the division of lands of the department of conservation and natural resources shall be entitled to one percent of all proceeds of any oil and gas capital payments as defined in this amendment subsequent to August 14, 1984, which sum shall be carried in the state treasury to the credit of the state lands fund. In addition, within 90 days after September 1, 2001, the board of trustees of the Alabama heritage trust fund shall transfer the trust capital of the Alabama heritage trust fund to the Alabama trust fund and shall transfer the trust income of the Alabama heritage trust fund to the state general fund. The trust capital received by the Alabama trust fund from the Alabama heritage trust fund shall thereafter be trust capital of the Alabama trust fund. The Alabama heritage trust fund, the board of trustees of the Alabama heritage trust fund, and all other aspects of the Alabama heritage trust fund shall terminate and dissolve 90 days after September 1, 2001.

(c) Provided, however, beginning with state fiscal year 1989-90, one percent of the income from the Alabama trust fund shall be reinvested in the Alabama trust fund; two percent of such income shall be reinvested in the following year; and one additional percent of such income each subsequent year shall be reinvested until a total of 10 percent of such income from the Alabama trust fund each year shall be reinvested in the Alabama trust fund.

##### Section 5

. (a) The trust capital shall be held in perpetual trust and shall not be appropriated by the legislature or expended or disbursed for any purpose other than to acquire eligible investments in accordance with the provisions of this amendment. All eligible investments acquired, in whole or in part, with moneys constituting part of the trust capital shall to the extent of such moneys constitute part of the trust capital, but any trust income derived therefrom shall be paid directly into the general fund as it is received by the board, subject to appropriation and withdrawal by the legislature.

(b) To the extent practicable, the board shall keep all moneys at any time held in the trust fund invested in such eligible investments as shall, in its sole and uncontrolled judgment, produce the greatest trust income over the term of such investments while preserving the trust capital. In making any investment of moneys held in the trust fund, the board shall exercise the judgment and care, under the circumstances prevailing at the time of such investment, which an institutional investor of the highest standard of prudence, intelligence and financial expertise would exercise in the management and investment of large assets entrusted to it not for the purpose of speculative profit but for the permanent generation and disposition of funds, considering the probable safety of capital as well as the expected amount and frequency of income. The board shall have full power and authority to select the eligible investments in which moneys held in the trust fund shall at any time be invested, and, to the extent not inconsistent with any express provision of this amendment, the eligible investments so selected shall be acquired from such issuers, underwriters, brokers or other sellers on such terms and conditions; shall be acquired for purchase prices reflecting such discount below or premium above the par or face amount thereof; shall bear such dates and be in such form, denominations and series; shall mature or be subject to mandatory redemption on such dates; shall bear interest at such rate or rates payable at such intervals or, alternatively, shall provide income to the holder thereof in such manner (including, without limitation thereto, the purchase of such investments at a discount which represents all or part of the income or profit derived therefrom); shall be unsecured or secured in such manner and subject to the provisions of Section 2, paragraphs 2 and 3; shall contain such provisions for prepayment or redemption at the option of the issuer or obligor; and shall contain or be subject to such other provisions as shall, in all of the foregoing respects, be determined by the board in exercise of its sole and uncontrolled judgment. The board shall have full power and authority to invest the trust capital in any eligible investments producing trust income in accordance with such schedule as the board shall, in the exercise of its sole and uncontrolled judgment, determine to be in the best interests of the state, and in determining such schedule the board may emphasize future benefits in preference to near-term needs. The board shall have complete and uncontrolled discretion in making decisions as to when moneys in the trust fund shall be invested, as to the purchase price or other acquisition cost to be paid or incurred in acquiring investments for the trust fund, as to when investments constituting part of the trust fund shall be sold, liquidated or otherwise disposed of, and, as to the amount and nature of the price or other consideration to be received by the trust fund upon the sale, liquidation or other disposition of investments constituting part of the trust fund. No law shall be enacted nor any action taken by the executive department of the state which impairs or interferes with the power, authority and discretion conferred upon the board by this amendment with respect to the acquisition, management, control and disposition of investments at any time constituting part of the trust fund.

(b) To the extent appropriate and not at the time prohibited by law, the board shall use the facilities of the state treasurer in the administration of the trust fund, including, but without limitation thereto, the keeping of records, the management of bank accounts, the transfer of funds and the safekeeping of securities evidencing investments.

(c) The board shall cause an annual audit of the trust fund to be performed for each fiscal year by the state examiners of public accounts or, in the discretion of the board, by an independent certified public accounting firm and shall cause a report of such audit to be prepared in accordance with applicable accounting principles. The board shall cause to be prepared and publicized such financial and other information concerning the trust fund as may from time to time be provided by law duly enacted by the legislature, but in the absence of any law directing the preparation and publication of different reports, the board shall cause to be prepared and made public, within 30 days after the end of each quarterly period in each fiscal year, a report containing (i) a statement of the trust capital then held in the trust fund showing any changes thereto since the last quarterly report, (ii) a statement of the trust income received during the quarterly period in question, (iii) a statement of the investments then held in the trust fund including descriptions thereof and the respective values thereof, (iv) a statement of the trust income received to date during the current fiscal year, and (v) any other information determined by the board to reflect a full and complete disclosure of the financial operations of the fund.

. An individual trustee shall not in any way be personally liable for any liability, loss or expense suffered by the trust fund unless such liability, loss or expense arises out of or results from the willful misconduct or wrongdoing of such trustee.

##### Section 7

. This amendment shall be self-executing, but the legislature shall have the right and power to enact laws supplemental to this amendment and in furtherance of the purposes and objectives thereof, provided that such laws are not inconsistent with the express provisions of this amendment.

### Sec. 219.03 Investment of capital and income from Alabama Heritage Trust Fund or Alabama Trust Fund.

Any other provision of this Constitution to the contrary notwithstanding, trust capital and trust income held in either the Alabama heritage trust fund or the Alabama trust fund may be invested in such kinds of investments and in accordance with such conditions as shall from time to time be authorized by law for the investment of any of the trust funds of either the teachers' retirement system of Alabama or the employees' retirement system of Alabama; provided, however, that if any restrictive conditions at any time made applicable by law to either the teachers' retirement system of Alabama or the employees' retirement system of Alabama should prohibit investments that would otherwise be permitted for the Alabama trust fund by Amendment No. 450 to the Constitution of Alabama of 1901 [§ 219.02], then, notwithstanding the restrictive conditions applicable to said retirement systems, the investments permitted by said Amendment No. 450 [§ 219.02] shall be permitted for trust capital and trust income held in either the Alabama heritage trust fund or the Alabama trust fund; and provided further, that for purposes of implementing the preceding proviso with respect to the investment of funds held in the Alabama heritage trust fund, any provision of said Amendment No. 450 [§ 219.02] which refers to the whole or any percentage of the trust capital of the Alabama trust fund in connection with the investment thereof shall be deemed to refer to the trust capital of the Alabama heritage trust fund.

Any provision of this Constitution to the contrary notwithstanding, any capital gains realized from the sale of any investments forming a part of either the Alabama heritage trust fund or the Alabama trust fund shall become a part of the trust capital of the fund in which such investments were held and shall be subject to all restrictions applicable to the preservation of such trust capital.

### Sec. 219.04 County and Municipal Government Capital Improvement Trust Fund; Alabama Capital Improvement Trust Fund.

##### Section I.

 The Legislature finds that the capital improvements and technology required by many governmental programs could be more efficiently funded through the establishment of a special trust fund dedicated to funding such improvements. Additionally, municipal and county governments require assistance in the funding of capital improvements. In order to meet these requirements, it is necessary and prudent to redistribute a portion of the Oil and Gas Capital Payments now being paid into the Alabama Trust Fund under Amendment No. 450 to the Constitution of Alabama of 1901 [§ 219.02]. Accordingly, this amendment establishes the County and Municipal Government Capital Improvement Fund and the Alabama Capital Improvement Trust Fund to be administered in accordance with the provisions of this amendment.

Each organization submitting nominations may submit, to the appropriate appointing official for that position on the Board, the names of not more than two of its members who have the qualifications to serve in the position for which they are being nominated. In the event that no organization within a group recommends names to the appointing official, then that official may appoint a Trustee from that group solely of his own choice.

(E) Terms of office of the initial Trustees shall begin on the January 1 following ratification of this Amendment, or on the first day of the third month following said ratification, whichever shall first occur. Terms of office of successor Trustees shall begin and end on anniversaries of that date. In the case of the initial appointments of Trustees, nominations shall be made to the appropriate appointing officials not later than one month after ratification of this Amendment, and appointments by said officials shall be made by the date of beginning of the initial Trustees' terms of office. Nominations of successor Trustees shall be made to the appropriate appointing officials not later than two months prior to the expiration of the Trustees' terms of office, and said officials shall appoint new Trustees within 30 calendar days after the expiration of said terms. In the event a Trustee resigns or dies, or otherwise vacates his office, the Commissioner or the Secretary of State shall promptly notify the appropriate nominating organizations and shall publish notice of such vacancy once a week for three successive weeks in three newspapers of regional circulation in this state with a request for new nominations from any group that may qualify to do so under the provisions of this Amendment. Nominations for a replacement Trustee shall be made to the appointing official during the 30 calendar days following such death, resignation or other vacation of office, and the appointing official shall appoint a replacement Trustee not later than the end of the next succeeding 30 calendar days thereafter. In the event the appropriate appointing official fails to make an initial appointment or an appointment within said 30-day periods for appointment after expiration of term of office or after death, resignation or other vacation of office, the right to make an appointment to fill that vacancy shall fall to the next appointing official in line of rotation of the Governor to the Lieutenant Governor to the Speaker of the House (with the Governor then to follow the Speaker); and, if that successor appointing official fails to make such appointment within 30 days, then the right to make the appointment shall fall to the next succeeding appointing official, all to the end that there will, as nearly as possible, always be a full complement of Trustees on the Board. Trustees appointed to fill a vacancy other than by reason of expiration of term of office shall serve the remainder of the unexpired term of the Trustee being replaced.

(a) The Board is to meet at least quarterly each year for the transaction of its business and to review the progress of the Forever Wild Land Trust. It shall review written requests from state agencies, private organizations, and private citizens proposing that certain properties or interests therein be acquired. For purposes of establishing a quorum, there must be present at least three-fifths () of the members of the Board then in office at any Board meeting in order to conduct business; provided, however, that in absence of a quorum, the members present, by majority vote, may adjourn the meeting from time to time until a quorum shall attend. Any Board action or recommendation must be approved by at least three-fifths () of the members of the entire Board then in office, unless specified otherwise in this Amendment. Using its own knowledge and expertise, as well as the knowledge and expertise of the scientific community and state and federal agencies, the Board shall adopt a priority list of properties to be considered for acquisition. Recognizing that real estate transactions must involve willing sellers and may involve complicated procedures that could affect the availability of property, the Department shall, to the extent practicable, follow the directions of the Board in acquiring lands or waters. Provided, however, the Forever Wild Land Trust may only purchase or acquire an interest in property from the priority list of properties adopted by the Board.

(b) In addition to the site-specific management and allowable use guidelines referred to in Section 9, the Board may recommend to the Department rules, regulations and management criteria, which the Board feels would be beneficial to carrying out the goals and purposes of this Amendment.

(c) The Board shall assist the Department in developing and maintaining an inventory of areas and sites which through acquisition become state natural and/or recreational areas and shall make public as desirable information regarding their location, management, regulation, and permissible public uses.

(d) The Board shall prepare and submit to the Governor and the state Legislature, on or before February 1 of each year, a report which shall describe and account for all expenditures and acquisitions by the Forever Wild Land Trust for the preceding fiscal year, as well as plans for the current fiscal year. The Board shall present this annual report to the public at a public meeting to be held within ten days after February 1 of each year.

(e) Before purchasing or acquiring any interest in lands with moneys from the Forever Wild Land Trust, the Board, acting through the Commissioner, or the Commissioner on his own initiative, shall obtain at least two appraisals from certified real estate appraisers. In no event shall the Board expend more than the "appraised value", as defined in Section 2 of this Amendment, in purchasing such lands; provided, however, that by affirmative vote of at least three-fourths () of the members of the Board, the Board may expend up to 125 percent of the appraised value for such purchase where such action is necessary to accomplish the purposes and goals of this Amendment.

(f) The Board may assume indebtedness on behalf of the Forever Wild Land Trust that may be owed with respect to real or personal property given, donated, contributed or devised to the Forever Wild Land Trust, or that may be secured by a mortgage, deed of trust or security interest covering such property, and to agree to pay such indebtedness from current assets or future revenues of the Forever Wild Land Trust; provided that the present value of all installments of principal and of interest on such indebtedness at the time of the assumption thereof, determined in accordance with accepted principles and using a discount rate equal to the rate of interest payable on such indebtedness, shall be less than 80% of the fair market value of such property as determined by an active public market for such property or an appraisal performed by an independent, professionally qualified appraiser.

(g) The Board may contract for the purchase of tracts or parcels of land in which the purchase price shall be payable in future installments, together with such rate of interest on the unpaid balance of such purchase price as the Board shall determine to be reasonable, and to secure the payment of such installments, together with the interest thereon, by purchase money mortgages on the land so acquired and by a pledge of future revenues committed to the Forever Wild Land Trust, including, without limitation thereto, any portion of the trust income allocated to said trust by Section 7 of this Amendment; provided that such installments shall in no event exceed 80% of the fair market value of such property determined as set forth in the preceding subsection and provided further that the total cumulative indebtedness assumed each year under the preceding sub-section (f) together with the total cumulative indebtedness incurred each year by purchase money mortgages as provided in this sub-section (g) shall be limited to no more than 25% of the trust income allocated to said trust for the preceding year.

(h) The Board may enter into contracts with any person, nonprofit organization, corporation, governmental entity or other entity concerning tracts or parcels of land that constitute desirable acquisitions for the Forever Wild Land Trust pursuant to which such person, nonprofit organization, corporation, governmental entity or other entity will agree to acquire and hold such land, or to hold such land if theretofore acquired by such person, nonprofit organization, corporation, governmental entity or other entity and to sell or donate such land to the Forever Wild Land Trust at some future date, in the interim preserving and managing such land in its natural state subject to such conditions, including the reimbursement of expenses, as the Board shall deem advantageous for the ultimate acquisition and preservation of such land.

(i) The Board may sell, lease or exchange specific properties or interests therein acquired or held by the Alabama Trust Fund for the Forever Wild Land Trust. Any such sale or exchange shall be made at not less than the "appraised value", as defined in Section 2 of this Amendment; provided, however, that by affirmative vote of at least three-fourths () of the members of the Board, the Board may authorize and direct the Commissioner to sell or exchange property of said trust for not less than 85 percent of the appraised value where such action is necessary to accomplish the purposes and goals of the Amendment. All moneys received from any such sale or lease shall be paid into the Forever Wild Land Trust.

(j) The Board shall establish a technical advisory committee, consisting of the State Forester, the President of the Alabama Chapter of the Wildlife Society, the State Geologist, and any other person whom the Board may desire to appoint, for the purpose of obtaining advice and assistance in performing the Board's functions and duties under this Amendment.

(k) In addition, the Board is authorized at its discretion:

(1) to establish procedures relating to the confidentiality of information where necessary to accomplish the purposes and goals of this Amendment;

,(2) to cooperate or contract with any federal, state or local government agency, private organization, or individual to accomplish any of the purposes and goals of this Amendment, paying any reasonable fees or expenses in connection with such cooperation or contracts from moneys held under or within the Forever Wild Land Trust;

,(3) to recommend that moneys paid into the Forever Wild Land Trust be allowed to accumulate, with only the income thereon being spent, or that the corpus or principal of the Forever Wild Land Trust be expended in whole or in part;

,(4) to do any and all things necessary to take advantage of federal, state, or local government or private funds donated or obtainable through the use of the Forever Wild Land Trust; and

,(5) to adopt, alter and repeal bylaws, regulations and rules in accordance with the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act for the regulation and conduct of its affairs and business in accordance with the provisions of the Alabama Administrative Procedures Act.

##### (l)

 Members of the Board and the technical advisory committee shall be entitled to receive the per diem allowance and travel expenses provided by law to state employees. These expense payments shall be for the sole purpose of travel to and from their places of residence to meetings and for travel involving official business of the Forever Wild Land Trust. Those members who are state officials or employees shall serve without compensation or expense allowances other than that to which they are otherwise entitled in the positions they hold.

(m) The Commissioner and the Department are hereby specifically authorized and empowered to carry out all directions and recommendations of the Board made hereunder to accomplish the purposes of the Forever Wild Land Trust and this Amendment.

Said proposal shall include a legal description of the property to be purchased, leased or sold; the proposed purchase, lease or sale price; and any additional terms of the sale, purchase, lease or other interest therein. The Final Approval Committee shall approve or disapprove the proposal by a majority vote of the full membership of said Committee within 30 days after the date of submission of the proposal. Failure of the Committee to act within 30 days of submission shall constitute approval of said proposal.

##### Section 7. Source of Funds

.

(a) Beginning with the state's 1992-1993 fiscal year, there shall be allocated and paid into the Forever Wild Land Trust the percentage of trust income earned from the Alabama Trust Fund that would have been reinvested in the Alabama Trust Fund under Section 4(c) of § 219.02. Notwithstanding Section 4(c) of § 219.02 the percentage of trust income earned from the Alabama Trust Fund shall be allocated to the Forever Wild Land Trust as follows:

(1) For the 1992-1993 fiscal year, four percent (4%) of the trust income earned from the Alabama Trust Fund.

(2) For the 1993-1994 fiscal year, five percent (5%) of the trust income earned from the Alabama Trust Fund.

(3) For the 1994-1995 fiscal year, six percent (6%) of the trust income earned from the Alabama Trust Fund.

(4) For the 1995-1996 fiscal year, seven percent (7%) of the trust income earned from the Alabama Trust Fund.

(5) For the 1996-1997 fiscal year, eight percent (8%) of the trust income earned from the Alabama Trust Fund.

(6) For the 1997-1998 fiscal year, nine percent (9%) of the trust income earned from the Alabama Trust Fund.

(7) Thereafter, ten percent (10%) of the trust income earned from the Alabama Trust Fund; provided, however, that in no event shall such trust income paid to the Forever Wild Land Trust exceed $15 million in any one fiscal year.

(b) The Alabama Trust Fund Board shall provide the Board of Trustees of the Forever Wild Land Trust with advice and assistance in the investment of funds in the Forever Wild Land Trust.

(c) Title to the property acquired from funds in the Forever Wild Land Trust shall be held in the Alabama Trust Fund for the State of Alabama. Provided, however, the Alabama Trust Fund Board shall not have any responsibility for nor any control over the approving or disapproving of the acquisition, disposition or use of any such property. Nothing in this Section or § 219.02 shall be construed so as to require the Alabama Trust Fund Board to have a fiduciary responsibility for the investment of Forever Wild Land Trust funds or the production of income from property acquired by the Board of Trustees of the Forever Wild Land Trust.

(d) The amounts allocated to the Forever Wild Land Trust shall be included in determining whether the trust income received by the state from the Alabama Trust Fund equals or exceeds $60,000,000 for the purposes of the County Government Capital Improvement Act (codified at Sections 11-29-1 through 11-29-7 of the Code of Alabama, 1975, as amended) and the Municipal Government Capital Improvement Act (codified at Sections 11-66-1 through 11-66-7 of the Code of Alabama, 1975, as amended). In no event shall any provision hereof serve to decrease the amount of income from the Alabama Trust Fund which is to be appropriated to the Municipal Government Capital Improvement Fund and the County Government Capital Improvement Fund under the above-referenced acts.

##### Section 8. Donations of Property

.

Any person making a donation of any property or any interest therein, to the state for the purposes of this Amendment, shall receive, irrespective of any other provisions of the income tax laws of the state, twice the ordinary deduction for state income tax purposes for the taxable year in which the property or interest is donated. Provided, however, the value of any such property or interest therein, subject to this double deduction, shall be limited to the actual value of the property, or any interest therein, donated to the state which shall not include any indebtedness, encumbrances or liens assumed by the Forever Wild Land Trust or the value of any interests or rights retained by the donor.

For the purposes of this section, the "actual value" of property shall be the appraised value for ad valorem taxation purposes, averaged over the preceding five years.

##### Section 9. Stewardship Account

.

The Alabama Trust Fund Board shall establish a separate account within the Alabama Trust Fund to be known as the Forever Wild Land Trust Stewardship Account. When the Forever Wild Land Trust acquires property or an interest in property pursuant to this Amendment, the Board of Trustees of the Forever Wild Land Trust shall set aside an amount from the Forever Wild Land Trust equal to fifteen percent (15%) of the appraised value of the land acquired, or the land affected if less than a fee interest was acquired. The Alabama Trust Fund Board shall provide for the investment of the Stewardship Account. The Board of Trustees of the Alabama Forever Wild Land Trust may authorize the Department to expend any interest income generated from the investment of funds within the Stewardship Account by the Alabama Trust Fund Board. Provided, however, the Commissioner shall notify the Board of Trustees in writing if he determines that the interest income projected to be generated from the Forever Wild Land Trust Stewardship Account for the next fiscal year will be insufficient to properly manage property acquired by the Forever Wild Land Trust. The Board may authorize by a three-fifths () vote that funds within the corpus of the Forever Wild Land Trust Stewardship Account be expended by the Department for management purposes for the next fiscal year, provided that funds from the Stewardship Account may not be expended to purchase additional property or interests therein. Within one year after the Forever Wild Land Trust acquires any properties pursuant to this Amendment, the Board of Trustees of the Forever Wild Land Trust shall develop management and allowable use guidelines which shall be followed by the Department in the administration and stewardship of that piece of property. The Lands Division of the Department shall, in accordance with such general directions as may be given by the Board of Trustees, coordinate management of properties acquired pursuant to this Amendment and expenditures from the Stewardship Account. All lands will be managed under the multiple-use management principle; to insure that all resource values including recreation, hunting, fishing, boating, hiking, aesthetics, soil, water, forest management and minerals are protected or enhanced. No use will be allowed that is not compatible with the primary purpose for acquiring the land. In coordinating such management within the Department, the Game and Fish Division of the Department shall manage wildlife and fisheries programs; the State Parks Division of the Department shall manage parks programs; the Lands Division of the Department shall manage natural areas programs through its Natural Heritage Program; and the Lands Division of the Department shall manage other activities and programs relating to Forever Wild Land Trust properties. The Forestry Commission shall serve as consultant to the Department for the purpose of managing the forest and forestry resources programs. Any income that may be generated from the property or from any use of said property acquired through the Forever Wild Land Trust shall be treated as interest income of the Alabama Trust Fund and shall accrue to the credit of the general fund of the State of Alabama.

The right of the public to hunt and fish on the lands and easements acquired under the provisions of this act shall not be abridged or restricted, subject to such rules, regulations, seasons and limits as are established by the Department of Conservation and Natural Resources.

##### Section 10. Enforceability of Conservation Restrictions; Recordation; Acquisition and Disposal of Interests

.

(a) No conservation restriction or easement as defined in Section 2 of this Amendment held by any governmental body shall be unforceable on account of lack of privity of estate or contract or lack of benefit to particular land or on account of the benefit being assignable to or being assigned to any other governmental body with like purposes. All such restrictions and easements shall be duly recorded and indexed in the manner of other conveyances of interests in land, and shall describe the land subject to the restrictions or easements by adequate legal description or by reference to a recorded plat showing its boundaries.

Such conservation restrictions are interests in land and may be acquired by any governmental body which has power to acquire interests in land, in the same manner as it may acquire other interests in land. Such a restriction or easement may be enforced by injunction or proceeding in equity, and shall entitle the holder of it to enter the land in a reasonable manner and at reasonable times to assure compliance. Such a restriction or easement may be released in whole or in part, by the holder for such consideration, if any, as the holder may determine, in the same manner as the holder may dispose of land or other interest in land, subject to such conditions as may have been imposed at the time of creation of the restriction.

This section shall not be construed to imply that any restriction, easement, covenant or condition which does not have the benefit of this section shall, on account of any provision hereof, be unenforceable. Nothing in this Amendment shall diminish the powers granted by any law to acquire by purchase, gift, eminent domain or otherwise as restricting the use of an existing or future easement, express or implied, in favor of any utility or other holder of an easement for public purpose. The existence of conservation easements or restrictions shall not of itself be proof of value as a measure of damages in any eminent domain proceedings.

(b) When a conservation restriction or easement is held by public body under the program established by this Amendment, the real property subject thereto shall be assessed for taxation purposes on the basis of the true cash value of the property or as otherwise provided by law, less such reduction in value as may result from the granting of the conservation restriction or easement. The value of the interest held by the public body shall be exempt from property taxation to the same extent as other public property.

##### Section 11. Alabama Natural Heritage Program

.

(a) The Alabama Natural Heritage Program is hereby established as a part of the Lands Division of the Department, or its duly designated successor, and shall be funded from the Forever Wild Land Trust or the Forever Wild Land Trust Stewardship Account as provided by the Board, and from private donations.

(3) Develop a Natural Heritage Plan which suggests priorities for the protection, acquisition and management of dedicated natural area preserves.

(4) Establish procedures relating to the confidentiality of data and inquiries for information in order to protect natural resources and encourage use by public agencies and private organizations and individuals in planning or conducting their activities.

(a) The Department shall, in the name of the State and upon the recommendation of the Board, accept the dedication of natural areas on lands deemed by the Board and the Commissioner to qualify as natural area preserves under the provisions of this Amendment. Natural area preserves may be offered for dedication by voluntary act of the owner. The owner of a qualified natural area may transfer fee simple title or other interest in land to the State. Natural area preserves may be acquired by gift, grant or purchase.

(b) Dedication of a natural area preserve shall become effective only upon acceptance of the instrument of dedication by the Board and the Commissioner.

(c) The instrument of dedication may:

(1) Contain restrictions and other provisions relating to management, use, development, transfer, and public access, and may contain any other restrictions and provisions as may be necessary or advisable to further the purposes of this Amendment;

,(2) Define, consistent with the purposes of this Amendment, the respective rights and duties of the owner and of the state and provide procedures to be followed in case of violations of the restrictions;

,(3) Recognize and create reversionary rights, transfers upon condition or with limitations, and gifts over; and

,(4) Vary in provisions from one natural area preserve to another in accordance with differences in the characteristics and conditions of the several areas.

(d) Public departments, commissions, boards, counties, municipalities, corporations, colleges, universities and all other agencies and instrumentalities of the state and its political subdivisions may dedicate suitable areas within their jurisdiction as natural area preserves in accordance with the powers and authorities granted to such organizations by existing state legislation.

(e) The Board may enter into amendments to the instrument of dedication upon finding that such amendments will not permit an impairment, disturbance, use, or development of the area inconsistent with the provisions of this Amendment. If the fee simple estate in the natural area preserve is not held by the state under this article, no amendment may be made without the written consent of the owner of the other interests therein.

##### Section 13. Sunset Provision

Beginning with the state's 2012-2013 fiscal year and each succeeding fiscal year, all moneys to be paid into the Forever Wild Land Trust shall be paid to the Alabama Trust Fund in the event the Legislature has not provided for the continuation of payments into the Forever Wild Land Trust Fund as provided for in this section, provided that 2.5% of the trust income earned from the investment of funds in the Alabama Trust Fund shall continue to be paid to the Forever Wild Stewardship Account established in Section 9 of this Amendment until such time as the Legislature, by legislative act, determines that interest income earned from the investment of funds within the corpus of the Stewardship Account is sufficient for the proper administration and stewardship of properties acquired from the Forever Wild Land Trust. And provided further, that the Legislature, by legislative act, or by the enactment of a constitutional amendment may continue payment of the revenues provided in Section 7 hereof, or at any time provide for the payment of other revenues, into the Forever Wild Land Trust. At such time as the payment of trust income into the Forever Wild Land Trust shall cease, the percentage of trust income accruing to said trust fund shall be paid into the Alabama Trust Fund each year to become a part of the corpus of the Alabama Trust Fund.

##### Section 14. Amendment Self-Executing

 It is the policy of the state of Alabama to foster and promote the education of its citizens in a manner and extent consistent with its available resources, and the willingness and ability of the individual student, but nothing in this Constitution shall be construed as creating or recognizing any right to education or training at public expense, nor as limiting the authority and duty of the legislature in furthering or providing for education.

##### Section III.

 (a) Within thirty days following ratification of this constitutional amendment there shall be created within the Alabama Trust Fund the Education Trust Fund Rainy Day Account and the General Fund Rainy Day Account. In any year in which the Governor certifies to the state comptroller and notifies the Legislature that proration would occur in appropriations from the Education Trust Fund or the State General Fund, the Education Trust Fund Rainy Day Account or the General Fund Rainy Day Account shall be credited with Oil and Gas Capital Payments previously transferred into the Alabama Trust Fund in the amount required to fund withdrawals from the Account of the amounts authorized by this section. However, the amount withdrawn from the Education Trust Fund Rainy Day Account in a fiscal year may not exceed six and one-half percent of the previous fiscal year's Education Trust Fund appropriations less the total amount of any prior years' withdrawals from the Account which have not been repaid to the Account, as provided for in subsections (b), (c), and (e).

The Governor shall certify to the state comptroller and notify the Legislature that proration would occur in appropriations from the Education Trust Fund or the General Fund in accordance with this constitution. Upon the certification by the Governor, and after all other sources available to be used to offset proration have been utilized, withdrawals from the Education Trust Fund Rainy Day Account or the General Fund Rainy Day Account may be made; however, withdrawals shall be limited to the amount of the anticipated proration and funds allotted only to the extent necessary to avoid proration of appropriations from the Education Trust Fund or the General Fund as limited by this section.

(b) The Finance Director shall ensure that if during the fiscal year, receipts to the Education Trust Fund or the General Fund (net of the Education Trust Fund or the General Fund Rainy Day Account payments) are sufficient to reduce anticipated proration which has been certified by the Governor to the state comptroller and for which funds have been withdrawn, then the amount corresponding to the reduced anticipated proration percentage shall be transferred back to the Education Trust Fund or the General Fund Rainy Day Account within the Alabama Trust Fund within thirty days after the end of the fiscal year in which the withdrawals were made. Any amount transferred back to the Education Trust Fund or the General Fund Rainy Day Account shall necessitate a transfer of an additional amount equal to twenty-five percent of that amount from the County and Municipal Government Capital Improvement Fund into the Education Trust Fund or the General Fund Rainy Day Account within the Alabama Trust Fund.

(c) The Legislature may provide by statute for the replenishment of the Education Trust Fund or the General Fund Rainy Day Account within the Alabama Trust Fund from sources other than the Alabama Trust Fund or Oil and Gas Capital Payments.

If it rejects the names of any members, it shall thereupon elect trustees in the stead of those rejected. No trustee shall receive any pay or emolument other than his actual expenses incurred in the discharge of his duties as such. Upon the vacation of office by a trustee, the board, if it desires, may bestow upon a trustee the honorary title of trustee emeritus, but such status shall confer no responsibilities, duties, rights, or privileges as such.

The governing body of Baldwin county may call an election at any time, and it shall be the duty of such governing body to call an election to be held within ninety days after receipt by it of a petition signed by not less than 5% of the qualified electors of said election precincts numbered one through seven, requesting that such election be called.

Whenever such tax shall have been authorized by vote of such qualified electors, and levied by the governing body of Baldwin county, such governing body may anticipate the proceeds therefrom for any one or more of the purposes for which the tax shall have been voted, by issuing, without further election, interest bearing tax anticipation bonds, warrants, or certificates of indebtedness of said county payable solely from and secured by a pledge of a sufficient amount of the annual proceeds from said tax received by the county.

The governing body of Baldwin county shall have power to designate as the agency of the county, to construct, acquire, equip, operate and maintain public hospital facilities for said election precincts numbered one through seven any public corporation heretofore or hereafter organized for hospital purposes in the county.

No securities issued or contracts made by Baldwin county under the authority of this amendment, which are payable solely out of the proceeds of said tax, and no securities issued or contracts made by any such public corporation, whether or not issued or made under the authority of this amendment, shall be construed to be bonds of Baldwin county or of a political subdivision thereof within the meaning of section 222 of the Constitution, or construed to create or constitute an indebtedness of the county within the meaning of section 224 of the Constitution.

Whenever such tax shall have been authorized by vote of such qualified electors, and levied by the governing body of Baldwin County, such governing body may anticipate the proceeds therefrom for any one or more of the purposes for which the tax shall have been voted, by issuing, without further election, interest bearing tax anticipation bonds, warrants, or certificates of indebtedness of said county payable solely from and secured by a pledge of a sufficient amount of the annual proceeds from said tax received by the county.

The governing body of Baldwin County shall have power to designate as the agency of the county, to construct, acquire, equip, operate and maintain public hospital facilities for said election precincts numbered one through seven any public corporation heretofore or hereafter organized for hospital purposes in the county. When a public corporation shall have been so designated, the proceeds of said tax thereafter collected shall be paid to it and shall be used by it for any one or more of the purposes for which the tax shall have been voted; provided, that payments of the proceeds of said tax to said public corporation shall be made only to such extent as will not result in the impairment of the obligation of any contract theretofore made with respect to said tax. Said public corporation may anticipate the proceeds from said tax so required to be paid to it by issuing, for any one or more of the purposes for which the tax shall have been voted, the bonds, warrants, or certificates of indebtedness of said corporation, and may pledge for the payment of the principal thereof and interest thereon a sufficient amount of the annual proceeds from said tax so paid to it.

No securities issued or contracts made by Baldwin County under the authority of this amendment, which are payable solely out of the proceeds of said tax, and no securities issued or contracts made by any such public corporation, whether or not issued or made under the authority of this amendment, shall be construed to be bonds of Baldwin County or of a political subdivision thereof within the meaning of Section 222 of the Constitution, or construed to create or constitute an indebtedness of the county within the meaning of Section 224 of the Constitution. Said securities shall be construed to be negotiable instruments notwithstanding the fact that they may be payable solely from a limited source. All pledges of said tax and all contracts made with respect thereto pursuant to the provisions of this amendment shall take precedence in the order in which they are made and shall create a charge on the proceeds of said tax prior to the expenses of operating and maintaining any public hospital facilities.

As used in this act, the term "election precincts" means the election precincts or beats of the county as they existed on July 27, 1965.

A. In addition to all taxes now or hereafter authorized by the Constitution of Alabama, including Section 215.05, Baldwin county or any incorporated municipality within such county which supports, jointly supports, or proposes to support a public library is hereby authorized to levy and collect a special tax of not more than forty-five cents on each one hundred dollars worth of taxable property within such county or municipality as assessed for state taxation. The proceeds of all such taxes shall be used exclusively for public library purposes; provided, that the levy of such tax, the rate of such tax and the purpose thereof shall have been first submitted to the vote of the qualified electors of the county or municipality and voted for by a majority of those voting at such election.

B. Upon petition signed by four hundred or more qualified electors of Baldwin county to the Baldwin county commission or like governing body, or upon a petition signed by two hundred or more qualified electors of any municipality in such county to the governing body of such municipality, the county commission or the governing body of the municipality shall order an election to be held to determine whether a special tax shall be levied at the rate specified by the governing body of such county or municipality for public library purposes.

C. Elections under this amendment relative to additional county taxes for county public library purposes shall be held at the same time any other general or special election is held in which the voters of the entire county are qualified to vote, and elections under this amendment relative to municipal taxes for municipal library purposes shall be held at the same time any other municipal election is held.

D. If authorized by the vote of the majority of the qualified electors voting in any such election called for the purpose, the county or city governing body, as the case may be, shall levy and collect, in addition to all other taxes authorized by law, a special annual ad valorem tax at the rate prescribed and approved by the electors voting in the election. If the majority vote at any election held hereunder is not in favor of the levy of the tax, or if at any such election the special tax shall be voted at a rate of less than forty-five cents on each one hundred dollars worth of taxable property, then the governing body of the county or city, as the case may be, may from time to time thereafter call other elections hereunder on the levy of the special tax or on the increase of the rate thereof, up to but not exceeding a total amount of forty-five cents on each one hundred dollars of taxable property, and must call any such election at the next general or special countywide election or next municipal election, as the case may be, next following the receipt of a petition in the manner and form herein prescribed. Provided, however, that not more than one election upon the levy or upon the increase of the rate of the special tax shall be held during any period of twelve consecutive months. After the special tax shall have been levied for a period of three years, the governing body of the county or city, as the case may be, upon its own original action may from time to time thereafter call other elections hereunder on the question of the discontinuance of the tax or a reduction on the rate thereof, upon the payment in full of all obligations then outstanding, if any, and when a reduced rate will provide sufficient revenue for the purposes for which the tax was levied. If the majority of electors participating in the election vote in favor of the discontinuance or reduction in the rate of the tax, as the case may be, such discontinuance or reduction shall become effective for the tax year next succeeding the tax year in which such election is held. Provided, that not more than one election for the discontinuance or reduction in the rate of the special tax shall be held during any period of twelve consecutive months. All such elections shall be called, held and conducted in the same manner as are elections proposing the special tax.

###### § 8-11.00 Fire Protection Purposes.

The Legislature declares that the fire departments which receive funds pursuant to this amendment are organizations which are public in nature as they promote and protect the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of the county.

In addition to all other taxes now or hereafter provided by law, there shall be levied and collected in Calhoun County a special county-wide property tax of three mills on each one dollar's worth of taxable property as assessed for the state ad valorem taxation. The proceeds of the additional taxes levied by this amendment shall be used exclusively for fire protection services provided by volunteer and full-time fire departments.

The Tax Assessor of Calhoun County shall assess the tax herein provided for and the tax collector shall collect the tax in the same manner and method that other ad valorem taxes are collected. The proceeds of the tax shall be paid by the tax collector directly to the Calhoun County Volunteer Firefighters' Association and to the cities. The proceeds shall be divided so that the proceeds of the tax collected within the corporate limits of any city within the county shall be allocated to the fire department of that city and the proceeds from collections in the unincorporated areas of the county shall be allocated among the volunteer fire departments which serve the unincorporated area of the county, based on the following formula:

(a) One-third of the proceeds shall be equally divided among the volunteer fire departments which are in good standing with the Calhoun County Volunteer Firefighters' Association.

(b) One-third of the proceeds shall be divided to each volunteer fire department based upon the number of people who live within each respective fire district.

(c) One-third of the proceeds shall be divided to each volunteer fire department based upon the number of acres of land contained in each fire district.

From the proceeds collected in the police jurisdiction, but outside the corporate limits, of any city, one-third shall be allocated for the city serving the police jurisdiction and two-thirds shall be allocated to the Calhoun County Volunteer Firefighters' Association to be divided as herein prescribed.

An eligible fire department, for purposes of this amendment, means a fire department in Calhoun County which is a member in good standing with the Calhoun County Volunteer Firefighters' Association according to guidelines established by the Alabama Volunteer Fire Department Association.

Funds paid to eligible fire departments shall be expended for fire protection and rescue services including training, supplies, equipment, and facilities. The funds may also be expended to purchase insurance to insure coverage of acts or omissions which are directly related to the functions of a fire department which are committed by the department or the personnel of a fire department and to insure assets of the fire department. The funds may not be expended for food, drink, social activities, salaries, or fund-raising activities. After receiving funds, the fire departments shall keep accurate records to verify that the funds were properly expended. The records shall reasonably be open to the public for inspection. By September 15 of each year, the association shall file a financial statement with the Calhoun County Commission detailing the expenditure of all funds received from this amendment during the previous 12 months. The filing shall also account for all unspent funds and whether the unspent funds have been obligated.

##### § 8A-2.00 Special School Tax.

(A) In addition to any taxes now authorized, or that may be hereafter authorized, by the Constitution and laws of Alabama, there is hereby levied a special school tax of fifty cents on each one hundred dollars worth of taxable property in the school tax district of the city of Anniston in Calhoun county, to be used solely for public school purposes, such tax to be levied and collected for a period of thirty years commencing with the tax year beginning October 1, 1977, with the first year's tax being payable October 1, 1978; provided such tax and the time it is to continue shall have been first submitted to the vote of the qualified electors of the school district in which such tax is to be collected, and voted for by a majority of those voting at such election; otherwise said tax shall not be collected. A special separate election is hereby called on the first Tuesday after sixty days following the date this amendment becomes effective, to be held in the school tax district of the city of Anniston in Calhoun county, at which election the qualified voters in said school tax district may vote as to whether said special school tax herein levied shall be effective; and if the majority of those voting at said election vote in favor of said special school tax, such school tax shall, commencing with the tax year beginning October 1, 1977, be levied and collected as other property taxes in said school district are levied and collected for a period of thirty years. If the proceeds of the tax are pledged to the payment of the principal and interest of the bonds hereinafter provided for, the tax collector of Calhoun county shall, upon collection thereof, pay such proceeds to the city of Anniston, and if the proceeds of the tax are not so pledged, he shall pay such proceeds to the board of education of the city of Anniston. This section shall be self-executing.

(B) After said tax has been voted, and without further authorization, and notwithstanding that any such request may be made prior to October 1, 1977, the city of Anniston shall, as and when requested by the board of education of Anniston, issue and sell interest bearing bonds, with principal and interest to be paid from the proceeds to be derived from said special school tax, for the sole purpose of construction and improvement of school buildings within such school tax district, and acquiring sites therefor. The net proceeds of the sale of such bonds shall be immediately paid to the board of education of the city of Anniston. The proceeds to be derived from said special school tax may be pledged by the city of Anniston for the payment of said bonds and the interest thereon, but said bonds shall not be a general obligation of the city of Anniston or of Calhoun county, and shall not be charged to the constitutional debt limit of the city of Anniston or of Calhoun county.

(C) Except as herein otherwise provided the election hereinabove provided for shall be called, held and conducted as provided for by law for the calling, holding and conducting of district school tax elections; provided, however, that the governing body of the city of Anniston shall call said election, it shall give at least thirty days' notice thereof by publication in some newspaper published in the city of Anniston and by written notices posted in three public places within the city for at least thirty days prior to said election, it shall appoint and designate the officers, managers, clerks and returning officers to conduct said election, it shall furnish the supplies and facilities necessary for the holding of said election, it shall pay out of the city treasury the expenses incident to the holding of said election, it shall designate the polling places to be used in said election, and it shall canvass, tabulate and declare the result of said election.

##### § 8A-2.01 Application of Special School Tax.

(A) The purpose of this amendment is to clarify and make further provisions regarding the public school purposes for which the following special school taxes, heretofore voted in the school district of the city of Anniston, may be applied: (1) The special annual ad valorem school tax at the rate of fifty cents (50¢) on each one hundred dollars ($100.00) of taxable property which was voted for public school purposes at the special election held in the said school district on March 16, 1948, pursuant to call of the said election made in Section 8-10.20, and which was levied by Section 8-10.20 for public school purposes in the said school district for a period of thirty years commencing with the tax year beginning October 1, 1947, and with the last year's tax being payable October 1, 1977; and (2) the special annual ad valorem school tax at the same rate which was voted for public school purposes at the special election held in the said school district on February 15, 1966, pursuant to call of the said election made in Section 8A-2.00, and which was levied by Section 8A-2.00 for public school purposes in the said school district for a period of thirty years commencing with the tax year beginning October 1, 1977, and with the first year's tax being payable October 1, 1978.

(B) In addition to the public school purposes specifically mentioned in Section 8-10.20, in Section 8A-2.00, and in Section 8-10.21, that portion of the proceeds from the special school tax levied by Section 8-10.20 in the school district of the city of Anniston that is not needed to pay debt service on bonds heretofore issued by the city of Anniston under Section 8-10.20 or under Section 8-10.21, or to comply with any other covenants contained in proceedings authorizing the issuance of the said bonds, and also the proceeds from the special school tax levied by Section 8A-2.00 may be used to pay the principal of and interest on any securities (including, but without limitation to, warrants) that may hereafter be issued by the city of Anniston, pursuant to request by the city board of education of Anniston, for the purpose of (i) paying costs of acquiring, constructing and improving public school buildings in the said school district, (ii) refunding the principal of warrants or other securities issued by the said city, after the effective date of Section 8A-2.00, for payment of costs of acquisition, construction and improvement of public school buildings, or (iii) the combined purpose of payment of such costs and such refunding. Costs of constructing a school building shall be deemed to include the costs of acquiring a site therefor. Any such securities may be either general obligations of the city of Anniston secured by a pledge of the proceeds of either or both of the said school taxes or may be special obligations of the said city payable solely out of and secured by a pledge of the proceeds of either or both of the said taxes; and any such securities shall be issued by the said city pursuant to the powers conferred on municipalities by existing statutes. Any pledges that may hereafter be made either hereunder or under Section 8A-2.00 with respect to the proceeds from the special school tax levied by Section 8A-2.00, shall take precedence in the order in which they are made. Any pledges that may hereafter be made either hereunder or under Section 8-10.21, with respect to the proceeds from the special school tax levied by Section 8-10.20 shall take precedence in the order in which they are made and shall be subordinate to the pledges heretofore made by the city of Anniston pursuant to either Section 8-10.20 or Section 8-10.21. If the proceeds of the tax levied by Section 8A-2.00 should at any time be pledged pursuant to either this amendment or Section 8A-2.00, the tax collector of Calhoun county shall, upon collection thereof, pay such proceeds to the city of Anniston; and until the proceeds of the special tax levied by Section 8A-2.00 are so pledged, he shall pay such proceeds to the board of education of the city of Anniston. If pledges are hereunder made with respect to either or both of the said special school taxes, and if the governing body of the city of Anniston shall hereafter determine that the proceeds from the tax or taxes so pledged are in excess of the amount needed to satisfy the said pledges and any other then outstanding pledges made under any of the other amendments herein referred to, then the said proceeds, to the extent of the said excess, may be applied for other public school purposes in the said school district.

(C) The provisions hereof are supplemental to Section 8-10.20, Section 8-10.21, and Section 8A-2.00 and the powers and authority herein granted shall be in addition to the powers and authority conferred by the said amendments.

(D) Each of the said special elections held as aforesaid on March 16, 1948, and on February 15, 1966, is hereby validated, in spite of any irregularities in connection with the giving of notice or the holding thereof or any other irregularity in connection therewith.

##### § 8A-2.02 Additional Special Ad Valorem Tax for Schools.

The city of Anniston shall have power to levy and collect a special property tax in addition to all other taxes now or hereafter authorized by the Constitution and laws of Alabama, of three mills on each dollar of taxable property situated therein, for educational purposes; provided that before such tax may be levied and collected the question of levying the tax, the purpose thereof, and the time such tax is proposed to be continued shall have been first submitted to a vote of the qualified electors of the city and voted for by a majority of those voting at the election. The election shall be ordered, held, and conducted as provided by law for calling, holding and conducting district school tax elections.

Each such appraisal shall be made not earlier than 180 days prior to the consummation of such sale. In any case where each appraisal obtained pursuant to the provisions hereof sets forth a different value, the average of the market values stated in the separate appraisals shall be deemed to constitute the reasonable market value of the property.

For purposes of the foregoing, any sale, lease, or other disposition of property for a price equal to the fair market value thereof shall not constitute the lending of credit or a granting of public funds or thing of value in aid of a private entity.

The recital in any bonds, warrants, notes, or other obligations or evidences or indebtedness that they were issued pursuant to this amendment or that they were issued to provide funds to be used in furtherance of any power or authority herein authorized shall be conclusive, and no purchaser or holder thereof need inquire further.

Premises

(4) . The term includes any building, as defined in this section, and any real property.

(c) A person may use deadly physical force, and is legally presumed to be justified in using deadly physical force in self-defense or the defense of another person, if the person reasonably believes that another person is using or about to use physical force against an employee, volunteer, member of a church, or any other person authorized to be on the premises of the church when the church is open or closed to the public while committing or attempting to commit a crime involving death, serious physical injury, robbery in the first degree, or kidnapping in the first degree.

(e) A person who uses force, including deadly physical force, as justified and permitted in this amendment is immune from criminal prosecution and civil action for the use of such force, unless the force was determined to be unlawful or in violation of Section 13A-3-21, Code of Alabama 1975.

(f)(1) Prior to the commencement of a trial in a case in which a defense is claimed under this amendment, the court having jurisdiction over the case, upon motion of the defendant, shall conduct a pretrial hearing to determine whether deadly force, used by the defendant was justified or whether it was unlawful under this amendment.

###### § 34-11.00 Fire Protection Purposes.

The Legislature declares that the fire departments which receive funds pursuant to this amendment are organizations which are public in nature, as they promote and protect the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of the county.

In addition to all other taxes now or hereafter provided by law, there shall be levied and collected in Henry County a special property tax of two mills on each one dollar's worth of taxable property as assessed for the state ad valorem taxation during the preceding year. The proceeds of the additional taxes levied by this amendment shall be used exclusively for fire protection services.

The Revenue Commissioner of Henry County shall assess the tax herein provided for, and shall collect the tax in the same manner and method that other ad valorem taxes are collected. The proceeds shall be divided by the revenue commissioner on an equal basis among the six eligible volunteer fire departments in the county.

An eligible fire department, for purposes of this amendment, means a fire department in Henry County which is a member in good standing with the Alabama Volunteer Fire Department Association.

Funds paid to eligible volunteer fire departments shall only be expended for fire protection services including training, supplies, and equipment. The funds may also be expended to purchase liability insurance to insure coverage of acts or omissions which are directly related to the functions of a fire department which are committed by the department or the personnel of a fire department. The funds may not be expended for food, drink, social activities, salaries, or fund-raising activities. After receiving funds, the fire departments shall keep accurate records to verify that the funds were properly expended. By September 15 of each year, each volunteer fire department shall file a financial statement with the Henry County Commission detailing the expenditure of all funds received from this amendment during the previous 12 months. The filing shall also account for all unspent funds and whether the unspent funds have been obligated.

Upon dissolution or abandonment of any eligible fire department, any remaining funds derived from this amendment or any assets purchased with funds derived from this amendment shall, after all indebtedness has been satisfied, be divided equally among the remaining volunteer fire departments in the county. In the event all of the volunteer fire departments are dissolved, the additional property tax levied under this amendment shall self-destruct and no longer be levied and collected.

The personnel of volunteer fire departments provided for in this amendment shall not be considered employees, servants, or agents of the county and the members of the county commission and the employees of the county shall not be liable in either their official capacity or in a private capacity for the actions of the personnel of fire departments.

This amendment shall apply to collections of ad valorem taxes for the 1996-97 tax year and thereafter. The initial provisions of this amendment may hereafter be amended by local legislation which may become effective without referendum approval.

#### CHAPTER 3. COUNTY GOVERNMENT, FINANCE, AND OPERATIONS.

##### Article 1. Finances

###### § 37-3.00 Bonds; Sewers.

In addition to any indebtedness now authorized, Jefferson county may become indebted and may issue bonds therefor in an amount not exceeding 3 percent of the assessed valuation of the taxable property in said county in order to pay the expenses of constructing, improving, extending and repairing sewers and sewerage treatment and disposal plants in said county. Said bonds shall be general obligations of Jefferson county but shall also be payable primarily from and secured by a lien upon the sewer rentals or service charges, which shall be levied and collected in an amount sufficient to pay the principal of and interest on such bonds, replacements, extensions and improvements to, and the cost of operation and maintenance of, the sewers and sewerage treatment and disposal plants. Such sewer rentals or service charges shall be levied upon and collected from the persons and property whose sewerage is disposed of or treated by the sewers or the sewerage treatment or disposal plants and whether served by the part of the sewer system then being constructed, improved, or extended or by some other part of such system; and such charges or rentals shall be a personal obligation of the occupant of the property the sewerage from which is disposed of by such sewers or treated in such plants and shall also be a lien upon such property, enforceable by a sale thereof.

Before issuing any bonds or levying or collecting any such sewer service charges or rentals, the proposal shall first be submitted to and approved by a majority of the voters of the county voting at an election to be called by the governing body thereof. Notice of such election shall be given by publication once a week for four successive weeks immediately prior to such election in a newspaper published and of general circulation in Jefferson county. Such notice and the ballot shall set forth the purpose for which the bonds are proposed to be issued, the estimated cost of the proposed undertaking, the amount of bonds to be issued, the serial maturities thereof, and the maximum rate of interest such bonds are to bear, and a recital that the proposal includes the levying of sewer service charges or rentals to be secured by liens upon the property served. Such elections shall in all respects not herein otherwise provided be conducted and the results thereof ascertained and declared in accordance with the law then in force relating to county bond elections. If at any such election a majority of the voters vote in favor of the proposed undertaking and the bonds, the bonds so voted may be issued at one time or from time to time as the governing body of the county shall deem advisable.

With the prior approval of the governing body of any incorporated municipality therein, Jefferson county may take over, own, possess, control, expand, improve, maintain and operate any sewers or sewerage treatment or disposal plants of such incorporated municipality or, if such incorporated municipality has no sewers, Jefferson county may construct sewers therein. Such sewers and plants shall thereupon become a part of a combined and consolidated sewer system for Jefferson county.

The governing body of Jefferson county shall have full power and authority to manage, operate, control and administer the sewers and plants herein provided for and, to that end, may make any reasonable and nondiscriminatory rules and regulations fixing rates and charges, providing for the payment, collection and enforcement thereof, and the protection of its property. Liens for sewer rentals or service charges shall be foreclosed in such manner as may be provided by law for foreclosing municipal assessments for public improvements. This amendment is self-executing.

The authority to issue bonds shall cease December 31, 1958. The authority to levy and collect sewer charges and rentals shall be limited to such charges as will pay the principal of and interest on the bonds and the reasonable expense of extending, improving, operating and maintaining said sewers and plants; and when the bonds shall have been paid off, service charges and rentals shall be accordingly reduced, it being the intent and purpose of this amendment that the expenses of needed improvements and extensions and maintenance and operation of the sewers and sewerage treatment and disposal plants and no other expenditures shall be paid from such service charges and rentals.

###### § 37-3.01 Bonds; Civic Centers.

Any corporation heretofore or hereafter created in any county of the state having a population of 500,000 or more, according to the last or any subsequent federal census, for the purpose of establishing, maintaining and operating a civic center in the municipality in which the county seat of such county is situated, shall be authorized, without the necessity of any election, to issue bonds, warrants or other evidences of indebtedness, and to pledge for the payment of the principal and interest due thereon any revenues received, or to be received, by such corporation and any tax proceeds appropriated or allocated (in whole or in part) to such public corporation by or pursuant to any act of the legislature of Alabama or by or pursuant to any resolution or ordinance of such county or any municipality therein, any provision of the Constitution or laws of Alabama to the contrary notwithstanding. No such bonds, warrants or other evidences of indebtedness issued by such corporation shall be considered indebtedness of such county or any municipality therein within the meaning of sections 224 and 225 of the Constitution of Alabama. The rent or rentals that the county or any such municipality may be obligated to pay under the terms of any lease between the said corporation and the said county or any such municipality shall not be considered as indebtedness of said county or any such municipality within the meaning of sections 224 and 225 of the Constitution of Alabama.

No tax levied by the state or any municipality or county of the state shall apply to any such corporation, unless such tax applies to the county and the city wherein the corporation is located. The word "tax" as herein used, shall include any ad valorem tax, or other direct tax, and any excise, privilege or license tax.

The following are hereby in all things validated and confirmed, any provision or provisions of the Constitution of Alabama of 1901 to the contrary notwithstanding: Acts numbered 524 [p. 767], 525 [p. 776] and 547 [p. 798] enacted at the 1965 regular session of the legislature of Alabama; Act No. 114 [p. 153] enacted at the second special session of 1965 of the legislature of Alabama; and all corporations established by said Act No. 547, as well as all acts done under the authority of any of said acts, including (without limitation) the acquisition of property, the making of contracts and the incurring of obligations and liabilities. Further, that certain bill introduced in the Alabama house of representatives on August 3, 1967 as House Bill 823, as said bill was finally enacted into law, is hereby validated and confirmed, any provision of the Constitution of 1901 to the contrary notwithstanding; provided that said bill (or a substitute therefor) is enacted by the legislature of Alabama and is approved by the governor (or becomes law without such approval).

Premises

(4) . The term includes any building, as defined in this section, and any real property.

(c) A person may use deadly physical force, and is legally presumed to be justified in using deadly physical force in self-defense or the defense of another person, if the person reasonably believes that another person is using or about to use physical force against an employee, volunteer, member of a church, or any other person authorized to be on the premises of the church when the church is open or closed to the public while committing or attempting to commit a crime involving death, serious physical injury, robbery in the first degree, or kidnapping in the first degree.

Marengo county is hereby authorized to incur indebtedness to the extent of not exceeding $400,000 in aggregate principal amount, and to issue its bonds in evidence of the indebtedness so incurred, for the purpose of constructing and equipping a new courthouse in said county. Said bonds may be issued only after the question of the issuance thereof shall have been submitted to the qualified electors of said county at an election called for that purpose by the governing body of said county and a majority of said qualified electors voting at said election shall have voted in favor of the issuance of said bonds, which election shall be called, held, conducted, canvassed and may be contested in the manner provided by the then existing laws of Alabama with respect to elections on the issuance of bonds by counties; provided however, that if a majority of the qualified electors of said county participating in the election on the adoption of this amendment shall vote for the adoption thereof then the approval of this amendment expressed by the vote in said county in favor of its adoption shall of itself authorize the issuance of the bonds, and in that event no additional election by the electors of said county shall be required to authorize the issuance of said bonds. In the event the majority vote in said county on the adoption of this amendment is against the adoption thereof, or in the event the majority vote at any election held in said county pursuant to the provisions of this amendment after its adoption is not in favor of the issuance of the bonds proposed at such election, the governing body of the said county may from time to time call other elections hereunder on the issuance of said bonds, but not more than one such election shall be held during any period of twelve consecutive months. The power to become indebted and to issue bonds in evidence of such indebtedness shall be in addition to all other powers which the said county may have under the Constitution and laws of Alabama, and any bonds issued pursuant to this amendment shall not be chargeable against the amount of indebtedness which said county may incur under the Constitution and laws of Alabama in effect prior to the adoption of this amendment. All bonds issued under this amendment shall be general obligations of the county secured by an irrevocable pledge of its full faith and credit, shall be issued in accordance with, and shall be subject to, the provisions of the general laws of Alabama existing at the time of the sale of said bonds respecting the maturities, sale, execution and redemption of bonds by counties.

The said county shall not, however, in any event have the power to levy said tax or any part thereof with respect to any tax year beginning after final payment and retirement of said bonds. The term "taxable property" as used in this amendment shall include any property that has heretofore been or may hereafter be exempted from county taxes pursuant to the provisions of sections 3 to 5, inclusive, of Title 51 of the Code of Alabama of 1940, as amended, or other similar statute, and the tax herein provided for, if authorized, levied and collected, shall be levied on and collected with respect to all such property just as if it had not been exempted from county taxes. Any provision of section 71 of Title 51 of the Code of Alabama of 1940 to the contrary notwithstanding, the tax herein provided for may, if authorized to be levied, be levied by the governing body of the county at any time prior to the September 1 next preceding the date on which such tax is to become due and payable.

When each series of bonds is issued, the maturities of the bonds of that series shall, to such extent as may be practicable, be so arranged that during each then succeeding fiscal year of the county the aggregate installments of principal and interest that will mature on all bonds that will be outstanding hereunder, immediately following the issuance of the bonds of that series, will be substantially equal; provided, that the determination by the said county governing body that the requirements of this sentence have been complied with shall be conclusive of such compliance and the purchasers of the bonds with respect to which such determination is made and all subsequent holders thereof shall be fully protected by such determination.

All bonds issued under the provisions of this amendment, together with the interest income therefrom, shall forever be exempt from all taxation in this state.

The provisions of this amendment shall be self-executing, and authorization from or other action by the legislature shall not be a prerequisite to the issuance of bonds hereunder; provided, however, that the legislature may enact appropriate legislation, not inconsistent with this amendment, respecting the use of the proceeds from the bonds and providing for the payment of the principal thereof and the interest thereon.

C. If a majority of the qualified electors of Mobile county participating in the election on the adoption of this amendment shall vote for adoption of this amendment, then the approval of this amendment expressed by the said vote in favor of its adoption shall of itself authorize the special tax and in that event no additional election by the voters of Mobile county shall be required to authorize the levy of the special tax. If the majority vote at any election held hereunder is not in favor of the levy of the tax, or if at any such election the special tax shall be voted at a rate of less than six mills on each dollar of taxable property in Mobile county, then the governing body of Mobile county may from time to time thereafter call other elections hereunder on the levy of the special tax or on the increase of the rate thereof, up to but not exceeding six mills on each dollar of taxable property, and must call any such election within three months after the receipt by the said governing body of a petition for the calling of such election signed by not less than five percent of the qualified electors of Mobile county; provided, however, that not more than one election upon the levy of the special tax or upon the increase in the rate thereof, up to but not exceeding six mills as aforesaid, shall be held during any period of twelve consecutive months.

All moneys derived from the collection of the special tax shall be paid over to the board as received and used by the board for public hospital purposes in the county. The board may anticipate the proceeds from the special tax by issuing for any one or more public hospital purposes the bonds, warrants, or other securities, of the board and may pledge for payment of the principal thereof and interest thereon not exceeding 75% of the annual proceeds from the special tax. All such pledges of the special tax shall take precedence in the order in which they are made and shall create a charge on the special tax prior to the expenses of operating and maintaining any public hospital facilities. Bonds and other securities issued by the board, including those that may be issued in anticipation of the special tax and also any other securities issued by the board, shall not be deemed to constitute debts of Mobile county within the meaning of section 224 of the Constitution and shall not be construed to be bonds of the county or of any political subdivision thereof within the meaning of section 222 of the Constitution.

E. The rate of ad valorem taxation for general municipal purposes that is at the time otherwise permitted by the Constitution to each particular municipal corporation in Mobile county shall be reduced for the tax year of the municipality next succeeding any tax year of Mobile county for which the special tax shall have been levied at a rate exceeding one and one-half mills on each dollar of taxable property in the county, any such reduction to be by a rate of millage equal to the rate by which the special tax levied for that tax year exceeds one and one-half mills on each dollar of such taxable property or by one and one-half mills on each dollar of taxable property in the county, whichever shall be the lesser reduction.

H. Mobile county and each municipal corporation therein are hereby prohibited from making any appropriation or payment to the board during any tax year of the county in which the special tax shall be collected, except to provide funds for constructing and equipping public hospital facilities, unless any such appropriation or payment shall have been authorized by a majority of the qualified electors of the political subdivision proposing to make such appropriation or payment at an election held on the question in the said political subdivision.

The department may exercise the same powers and perform the same duties in the same manner relative to the collection of the tax imposed by this amendment that it does relative to the collection of that tax, as long as it is authorized and directed to do so under the resolution adopted by the commission.

(4) In accordance with Section 40-25-2, Code of Alabama 1975, in the event tobacco stamps are not available for affixing to tobacco products packages and containers, or by the authority of a duly promulgated regulation eliminating the requirement of affixing county tobacco stamps, the Commissioner of the Department of Revenue may require a monthly report in lieu of stamps to report the amount of tax due. The monthly report shall be in a form approved by the commissioner and adopted by the department under the Alabama Administrative Procedure Act, Title 41, Chapter 22 of the Code of Alabama 1975.

Provided further, said governing body is hereby empowered to set fees for fire protection and to prescribe the manner of collection and distribution of such fees. The fire fighting districts herein authorized shall not include any corporate municipality of Montgomery county unless such municipality requests through resolution of its governing body to be included in such fire fighting program. Any act heretofore enacted regarding said Montgomery county fire fighting districts is hereby ratified and confirmed.

###### § 51-11.01 Fire Protection Purposes.

The Legislature declares that all volunteer fire departments, including volunteer fire departments that have emergency medical technicians that are members, are organizations that are public in nature and serve to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of Montgomery County.

In addition to all ad valorem taxes levied for fire protection, the Montgomery County Commission may levy and collect a special ad valorem tax, not to exceed five mills in any year on each dollar of assessed value of the property taxed, on property in the unincorporated area of Montgomery County for the purpose of providing fire protection in the unincorporated area of Montgomery County.

The tax provided in this act shall be levied, collected, administered, and enforced at the same time, in the same manner, and under the same requirements and laws as state ad valorem taxes. The officials collecting or assessing the tax shall be entitled to the same fees and compensation as are provided for collecting and assessing ad valorem taxes. The proceeds of the tax shall be paid into the county general fund. Within thirty days after payment into the county general fund, the Montgomery County Commission shall pay the funds to the Montgomery County Association of Volunteer Firefighters, hereafter referred to as the county association. The county association shall distribute the funds as follows:

In order to be an eligible volunteer fire department for purposes of this act, a volunteer fire department shall be in good standing with the Montgomery County Association of Volunteer Firefighters.

Funds disbursed to eligible volunteer fire departments pursuant to this act shall be expended only for fire protection and emergency medical services, including but not limited to, training, supplies, buildings, capital improvements, equipment, insurance, professional services, and dues. The funds shall not be expended for food, drink, social activities, or fund-raising activities. After receiving the funds, the volunteer fire departments shall keep accurate records to verify that the funds are properly expended. By September 15th of each year, the department shall file a report with the county association detailing the expenditure of all funds during the previous twelve months and setting out a schedule of all proposed projects. The filing shall account for all unspent funds and whether unspent funds have been obligated. Unspent funds that have not been obligated which exceed the amount of total receipts paid to the department for the prior year from this tax shall be returned to the county association for redistribution equally among the other fire departments. The county association shall supply the accounting forms to each eligible volunteer fire department. The copy of the year-end report shall be filed with the county commission and shall be audited by the Examiners of Public Accounts of the state on the same basis as county funds are audited.

Upon dissolution or abandonment of an eligible volunteer fire department, all remaining funds derived from this act or assets purchased with the funds derived from this act shall be transferred to the county association.

Prior to the levy of the fire protection tax in the unincorporated areas of county, there shall be submitted to the electors at a special election called for that purpose in the county, the question of whether the tax shall be levied. If a majority of the qualified electors within the unincorporated area of the county who vote at the election approve the tax, the tax shall be effective and levied. If a majority of the qualified electors within the unincorporated area of the county who vote at the election do not approve the tax, the tax shall not be effective and shall not be levied.

Elections on the question of the levy of a fire protection tax in the county may be held at any time and from time to time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if at an election held after the ratification of this amendment the proposal to levy the tax so submitted is defeated, then the proposal may not be submitted at another election held in the county within two years from the last election held under this amendment.

(1) 60 percent shall be divided equally among all eligible volunteer fire departments.

(2) 30 percent shall be divided according to a percentage based upon the monies collected in a fire district compared to the total monies collected. The county association shall notify the Revenue Commissioner within 30 days after this act becomes operative of the designated fire districts. The boundaries of the fire districts may be rearranged at the discretion of the county association as they deem necessary, from time to time, to maximize fire protection services in the county.

(3) Ten percent of the money shall be designated as discretionary fund of the county association to be used for any expenditure otherwise allowable under this act.

###### § 51-11.02 Fire Protection and Emergency Medical Services.

(a) This amendment shall not apply to the City of Montgomery in Montgomery County.

(b) The governing body of any incorporated municipality in Montgomery County to which this amendment applies may levy and impose a special ad valorem tax, not to exceed five mills in any year, on each dollar of assessed value of the property taxed, on property in the incorporated area of municipality for the purpose of financing fire protection and emergency medical services within the boundaries of the municipality. Financing such services may include, but not be limited to, entering contracts for the services with existing fire departments, volunteer fire departments, and emergency medical service providers.

(c) The Legislature by local law may provide for the administration, collection, and allocation of any revenues from the ad valorem taxes levied and imposed under this amendment so long as the allocations are made solely for fire protection and emergency medical services.

Neither the county nor the cities shall issue any bonds under the authority of this amendment, other than bonds issued to finance the acquisition or development of industrial sites, such development to include the extension and installation of streets and roadways and utility services, unless the question of the issuance of such bonds has first been submitted to the qualified electors of the county or the cities, as the case may be, and approved at such election by a majority of the qualified electors voting thereat. Each such election shall be called, held and conducted, and may be contested, in the manner provided by law for county or municipal bond elections, as the case may be. Bonds issued under the authority of this amendment shall not be considered indebtedness of the county or the cities, as the case may be, within the meaning of sections 224 and 225 of the Constitution of Alabama, but neither the county nor the cities shall at any time issue any bonds under the authority of this amendment if as a result thereof it will have outstanding an aggregate principal amount of bonds issued hereunder in excess of twenty percent of an assessed value of the property in the county or the cities, as the case may be. Neither shall the county or the cities issue any bonds under the authority of this amendment, except bonds issued to finance the acquisition or development of industrial sites, such development to include the extension and installation of streets and roadways and utility services, unless prior thereto or contemporaneously therewith the county or the cities, as the case may be, has entered into a lease or other similar agreement, with respect to the project being financed by such bonds, providing for the payment to the county or the cities, as the case may be, of net rentals sufficient to pay the principal of and the interest on such bonds at the respective maturities of such principal and interest, and any bonds issued hereunder shall be secured by a pledge of such rentals and may be secured by a foreclosable mortgage on such project and by a pledge of any other taxes and revenues which the county or the cities, as the case may be, is authorized by law to pledge to the payment of its bonded indebtedness.

For the purpose of refunding any securities, including refunding securities issued under the provisions of this amendment, whether the refunding shall occur before, at or after the maturity of the securities refunded and for the purpose of paying all premiums and expenses of the refunding (including attorneys' fees, costs of printing the refunding securities, fiscal agents' fees, and accountants' fees), the county is hereby authorized to sell and issue from time to time refunding securities in an aggregate principal amount not exceeding the sum of (a) the outstanding principal amount of the securities to be refunded, (b) the interest (accrued or to accrue) to the respective maturities of the securities to be refunded, or if the securities to be refunded are to be called for redemption, either on the earliest date on which under their terms they may be redeemed or some later date or dates, the interest (accrued or to accrue) on the securities to be refunded to the date or dates on which they are to be called for redemption, (c) the amount of any redemption premium required, by the terms of the securities, to be paid as a condition to their redemption prior to their respective maturities, and (d) the amount of any expenses (actual or estimated) of such refunding.

Proceeds of the special taxes that are not needed in any fiscal year to pay principal of and interest on securities issued hereunder or to refund securities shall be used to pay costs of constructing and maintaining the county facilities herein provided for, or to purchase and retire securities or call securities for redemption prior to the maturity thereof.

###### § 56-11.00 Fire Protection Purposes.

The Legislature declares that the fire departments and rescue squads which receive funds pursuant to this amendment are organizations which are public in nature as they promote and protect the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of the county.

In addition to all other taxes now or hereafter provided by law, there shall be levied and collected in Randolph County a special property tax of two mills on each one dollar's worth of taxable property as assessed for the state ad valorem taxation during the preceding year. The proceeds of the additional taxes levied by this amendment shall be used exclusively for fire protection and safety services.

The Revenue Commissioner of Randolph County shall assess the tax herein provided for and shall collect the tax in the same manner and method that other ad valorem taxes are collected. The proceeds of the tax shall be paid by the commissioner directly to the Randolph County Volunteer Fire Department Association. The proceeds shall be divided by the association so that the proceeds of the tax collected within the corporate limits of the City of Roanoke shall be allocated to the volunteer fire department of the city and the proceeds from collections in the unincorporated areas of the county shall be allocated equally among the volunteer fire departments and the rescue squad which serve the unincorporated area of the county.

The funds may not be expended for food, drink, social activities, salaries, or fund-raising activities. After receiving funds, the fire departments and rescue squads shall keep accurate records to verify that the funds were properly expended. By September 15 of each year, the association shall file a financial statement with the Randolph County Commission detailing the expenditure of all funds received from this amendment during the previous 12 months. The filing shall also account for all unspent funds and whether the unspent funds have been obligated. No new fire departments or rescue squads shall be funded within Randolph County without prior approval of the Randolph County Volunteer Fire Department Association.

Upon dissolution or abandonment of any eligible fire department or rescue squad, any remaining funds derived from this amendment or any assets purchased with funds derived from this amendment shall, after all indebtedness has been satisfied, be transferred to the Randolph County Volunteer Fire Department Association. The funds and assets shall be reallocated by the association equally to the other fire departments and rescue squads. In the event the association is dissolved, the additional property tax levied under this amendment shall self-destruct and no longer be levied and collected.

The personnel of fire departments and rescue squads provided for in this amendment shall not be considered employees, servants, or agents of the county and the members of the county commission and the employees of the county shall not be liable in either their official capacity or in a private capacity for the actions of the personnel of fire departments or rescue squads.

This amendment shall apply to collections of ad valorem taxes for the 1995-96 tax year and thereafter. The initial provisions of this amendment may hereafter be amended by local legislation which may become effective without referendum approval.

Such obligations or evidences of indebtedness may (in addition to any pledge or pledges authorized by subdivision 8 of this amendment) be issued upon the full faith and credit of the municipalities of Addison and Lynn, or may be limited as to the source of their payment.

7. To levy and collect annually, in addition to all other taxes now authorized or permitted, a special tax or taxes of not exceeding two percent on the value of all taxable property therein as determined for state taxation, in the same manner as other county or municipal taxes are levied and collected.

This amendment shall be self-executing; but the legislature shall have the right and power by general, special or local act to adopt laws supplemental to this amendment or in furtherance of the purposes and objectives hereinabove set forth.

10.
